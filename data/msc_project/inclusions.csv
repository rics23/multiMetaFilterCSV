The pivotal reason behind this phenomenon happens to be the ability of OSNs to provide a platform for users to connect with their family, friends, and colleagues. The information shared in social network and media spreads very fast, almost instantaneously which makes it attractive for attackers to gain information. Secrecy and surety of OSNs need to be inquired from various positions. There are numerous security and privacy issues related to the user’s shared information especially when a user uploads personal content such as photos, videos, and audios. The attacker can maliciously use shared information for illegitimate purposes. The risks are even higher if children are targeted. To address these issues, this paper presents a thorough review of different security and privacy threats and existing solutions that can provide security to social network users. We have also discussed OSN attacks on various OSN web applications by citing some statistics reports. In addition to this, we have discussed numerous defensive approaches to OSN security. Finally, this survey discusses open issues, challenges, and relevant security guidelines to achieve trustworthiness in online social networks. © 2021, The Author(s).",Cyber grooming; Cyberbullying; Online social network; Security and privacy; Social threats,,,,,,,,"Benson V., Saridakis G., Tennakoon H., Ezingeard J.N., The role of security notices and online consumer behaviour: an empirical study of social networking users, Int J Hum Comput Stud, 80, pp. 36-44, (2015); Fosso Wamba S., Akter S., Impact of Perceived Connectivity on Intention to Use Social Media: Modelling the Moderation Effects of Perceived Risk and Security, pp. 219-227, (2016); Sahoo S.R., Gupta B.B., Fake profile detection in multimedia big data on online social networks, Int J Inf Comput Secur, 12, 2-3, pp. 303-331, (2020); Bailey M., Cooke E., Jahanian F., Xu Y., Karir M A survey of botnet technology and defenses; Ahmed M., Mahmood A.N., Hu J., A survey of network anomaly detection techniques, J Netw Comput Appl, 60, pp. 19-31, (2016); Mislove A., Viswanath B., Gummadi K.P., Druschel P., You are who you know, .

As a consequence, online social deception (OSD) in SNSs has emerged as a serious threat in cyberspace, particularly for users vulnerable to such cyberattacks. Cyber attackers have exploited the sophisticated features of SNSs to carry out harmful OSD activities, such as financial fraud, privacy threat, or sexual/labor exploitation. Therefore, it is critical to understand OSD and develop effective countermeasures against OSD for building trustworthy SNSs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive survey, covering 1) the multidisciplinary concept of social deception; 2) types of OSD attacks and their unique characteristics compared to other social network attacks and cybercrimes; 3) comprehensive defense mechanisms embracing prevention, detection, and response (or mitigation) against OSD attacks along with their pros and cons; 4) datasets/metrics used for validation and verification; and 5) legal and ethical concerns related to OSD research. Based on this survey, we provide insights into the effectiveness of countermeasures and the lessons learned from the existing literature. We conclude our survey with in-depth discussions on the limitations of the state-of-the-art and suggest future research directions in OSD research. © 2013 IEEE.","cyberattacks; defense; detection, and response; Online social deception; online social networks; prevention; security; social media",Computer crime; Network security; Surveys; Defense mechanism; Effectiveness of countermeasures; Ethical concerns; Future research directions; On-line communication; Social network services; State of the art; Validation and verification; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Abutair H., Belghith A., Alahmadi S., CBR-PDS: A case-based reasoning phishing detection system, J.

Of particular concern are interactions between minors and adults with predatory intentions. Unfortunately, previous research on online sexual grooming has relied on time-intensive manual annotation by domain experts, limiting both the scale and scope of possible interventions. This work explores the possibility of detecting predatory behaviours with accuracy comparable to expert annotators using machine learning (ML). Using a dataset of 6771 chat messages sent by child sex offenders, labelled by two of the authors who are forensic psychology experts, we study how well can deep learning algorithms identify eleven known predatory behaviours. We find that the best-performing ML models are consistent but not on par with expert annotation. We therefore consider a system where an expert annotator validates the ML algorithms outputs. The combination of human decision-making and computer efficiency yields precision - but not recall - comparable to manual annotation, while taking only a fraction of the time needed by a human annotator. Our findings underscore the promise of ML as a tool for assisting researchers in this area, but also highlight the current limitations in reliably detecting online sexual exploitation using ML.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",chat logs; Child sexual exploitation; machine learning; natural language processing; online grooming,Decision making; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Chat logs; Child sexual exploitation; Communication strategy; Language processing; Machine-learning; Manual annotation; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online grooming; Predatory behavior; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Leverhulme Centre, (RC-2015-067); University of Liverpool, UoL, (9972)","Funding text 1: Given the nature of our topic, ethical approval was sought for the initial data collection and manual labelling of the Perverted Justice corpus.

The reviewed approaches are successful in most of the situations but have their own weaknesses. As such consideration is required for all stakeholders within the child protection arena. The utmost duty to protect children lies with all, irrespective of whether the abuse occurred on or offline. The reporting and intervention on child abuse cases were based on the community, as this was mostly offline perpetrated by parents or caregivers. However, with the advent of technology and the increasing use of the internet by children for several reasons, it has shifted most abuses from offline to online. The law enforcement authorities such as police plays a vital role in protecting children online and can apply different approaches compared to other agencies such as Social Services, Health, and Education. However, Government recommendations for a joint working response mean that all child-protected agencies need to work together in the process of protecting children (HM Government in Working together to safeguard children: a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, Department for Children, Schools, and Families, London, 2010). However, with the emergence of COVID-19 and the high reliance on the internet by children, it meant that the police must adapt to the changes and rely on advanced technologies such as AI. The UK Police force is stretched due to a lack of financial and human resources, which means that alternative intervention methods are applied in monitoring and attacking online child abuse. This chapter challenges the use of AI unilaterally in predicting and identifying online abuse as opposed to face-to-face investigation and intervention. Though AI can be helpful, it has limitations that can impact on protecting children online as discussed in this chapter. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Child protection; Child safety; Online abuse,,,,,,,,"Baidoo L, Zakrison TL, Feldmeth G, Lindau ST, Tung EL, Domestic violence police reporting and resources during the 2020 COVID-19 stay-at-home order in Chicago, Illinois, JAMA Netw Open, 4, 9, (2021); Beech M, COVID-19 pushes up Internet use 70% and streaming more than 12%, first figures reveal, (2022); Bollen J, Mao H, Zeng X-J, Twitter mood predicts the stock market, J Comput Sci, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Bouma H, Et al., Automatic analysis of online image data for law enforcement agencies by concept detection and instance search, Proceedings of the SPIE 10441 counterterrorism crime fighting forensics and surveillance technologies, (2017); Bromfield LM, Holzer PJ, A national approach for child protection: project report.

For that reason, the AI-powered child protection system helps protect children from modern cyber-attacks while offering parents more control over their children. Keyloggers, keystroke and mouse movement loggers help to collect data and can record user behaviour and find patterns. Furthermore, the use of those records is able to detect children's improper behaviour and reveal children's emotional states. Behavioral Data Extractor and Risk Analysis systems can analyze huge numbers of URLs and web content recorded by proxy, as well as application usage and screen times collected by background service. The Smart Resource Restricter is designed to help parents and children navigate the web safely and appropriately. The research can identify and prevent child predators. Indeed, cyberbullying and phishing attacks cross many boundaries, causing great harm to the community. It blocks outside threats and notifies parents of sexual and other online predators that often target children. The PandaGuardian successfully achieved its goal with the assistance of different algorithms and the respective outcomes. The model evaluation report, which compares all the methods, is a guardian companion. Parents could get assistance in order to safeguard their children from the day-to-day evolving cyber threats.  © 2021 IEEE.",Artificial intelligent; Behavioral data extractor; Child protection; Cyberbullying; Human feedback ex-tractor; Keylogger; Mouse movement; Phishing; Random forest; Smart resource restrictor,Behavioral research; Crime; Decision trees; Feedback; Mammals; Network security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Artificial intelligent; Behavioral data; Behavioral data extractor; Child protections; Cyber bullying; Data extractors; Human feedback ex-tractor; Mouse movements; Phishing; Random forests; Smart resource restrictor; Computer crime,,,,,,,"Acien A., Morales A., Monaco J.V., Vera-Rodriguez R., Fierrez J., TypeNet: Deep Learning Keystroke Biometrics, (2021); Ahmed A.A.E., Traore I., A new biometrie technology based on mouse dynamics, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 4, 3, pp. 165-179, (2007); Antal M., Egyed-Zsigmond E., Intrusion detection using mouse dynamics, IET Biometrics, 8, 5, pp. 285-294, (2019); Abdallah T., Iglesia B., URL-based web page classification: With ngram language models, International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering, and Knowledge Management, pp. 19-33, (2014); Pericherla I.S., A Study of Machine Learning Approaches to Detect Cyberbullying, (2021); Ramos J., Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries, Proceedings of the First Instructional Conference on Machine Learning, 242, pp. 133-142, (2003); McCallum A., Nigam K., A comparison of event models for näive bayes text classification, AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, 752, 1, pp. 41-48, (1998); Shen C., Cai Z., Guan X., Continuous authentication for mouse dynamics: A pattern-growth approach, Proceedings of the International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks, (2012); Tan Y.X.M., Binder A., Roy A., Insights from curve fitting models in mouse dynamics authentication systems, 2017 IEEE Conference on Applications, Information and Network Security, AINS 2017, pp. 42-47, (2017); Pericherla S.I., A Study of Machine Learning Approaches to Detect Cyberbullying, (2021); Nivedha S., Gokulan S., Karthik C., Gopinath R., Et al., Improving Phishing URL Detection Using Fuzzy Association Mining, (2017); Gan G., Et al., Data Clustering Theory, Algorithms, and Applications, American Statistical Association and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, (2007); Vapnik V., The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory, (1995); Vapnik V., Statistical Learning Theory, (1998); Dumais S.T., Platt J., Heckerman D., Sahami M., Inductive learning algorithms and representations for text categorization, Proceedings of ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 148-155, (1998); Lu P., Jia F., Qie J., MEMS-based human-body pose classification and monitoring system for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Modern Electronics Technique, 40, 16, pp. 169-172+177, (2017); Araujo M., Et al., Com2: Fast Automatic Discovery of Temporal ('Comet') Communities, Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, LNCS, 8444, pp. 271-283, (2014); Jiang M., Et al., Catchsync: Catching Synchronized Behavior in Large Directed Graphs, Proc. 20th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf.

In this study, we propose an effective method for sexual predator identification in online chats based on two-stage classification. The purpose of the first stage is to distinguish predatory conversations from the normal ones while the second stage aims to tell apart between the predator user and the victim within a single predatory conversation. Finally, some unique predators are derived from the second stage result. We investigate several machine learning classifiers including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree with Bag of Words features using several different term weighting methods for this task. We also proposed two ensemble techniques to improve the classification task. The experiment results on PAN12 dataset show that our best method using soft voting based ensemble for first stage and Naive Bayes based method for the second stage obtained an F0.5-score of 0.9348, which would place as number one in the PAN12 competition ranking. © 2020 IEEE.",classification; cyber grooming; online chats; sexual predator,Biometrics; Classifiers; Decision trees; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Bag of words; Classification tasks; Ensemble methods; Ensemble techniques; K-nearest neighbors; Naive bayes; Soft voting; Term weighting; Logistic regression,,,,,,,"Britain G., Children and parents: Media use and attitudes report, Ofcom, (2013); Madigan S., Villani V., Azzopardi C., Laut D., Smith T., Temple J.R., Browne D., Dimitropoulos G., The prevalence of unwanted online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth: A meta-analysis, Journal of Adolescent Health, 63, 2, pp. 133-141, (2018); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, 2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC).

The main aim of this study is to examine the effects of the ABC-based feature selection algorithm on classification performance for cyberbullying, which has become a significant worldwide social issue in recent years. With this purpose, the classification performance of the proposed ABC-based feature selection method is compared with three different traditional methods such as information gain, ReliefF and chi square. Experimental results present that ABC-based feature selection method outperforms than three traditional methods for the detection of cyberbullying. The Macro averaged F_measure of the data set is increased from 0.659 to 0.8 using proposed ABC-based feature selection method. © 2020 The British Computer Society 2020.

This capability has many benefits, but it can also be used by malevolent individuals, i.e. predators. Anonymity exacerbates the problem. The motivation of our work is to help protect our children from this potentially hostile environment, without excluding them from utilizing its benefits. In our research, we aim to develop an online sexual predator identification system, designed to detect cybercrime related to child grooming. We will use AI techniques to analyze chat interactions available from different social networks. However, before any meaningful analysis can be carried out, chats must be pre-processed into a consistent and suitable format. This task poses challenges in itself. In this paper we show how different and diverse chat formats can be automatically normalized into a consistent text-based format that can be subsequently used for analysis. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Chat logs; Deep learning; Online predator identification,Computer crime; Pattern recognition; AI techniques; Cybercrime; Data preprocessing; Hostile environments; On-line interactions; Social media; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Online chat”; Dan L., Identifying Cyber Predators by Using Sentiment Analysis and Recurrent Neural Networks, (2018); Ebrahimi M., Automatic identification of online predators in chat logs by anomaly detection and deep learning, M.Comp.Sc.

This study aimed to solve this challenge through analyses of routine chat times and online social networks. We sampled more than 550,000 online users over 6 months. We also used unsupervised and supervised machine learning to predict cyber offenders and victims and their offense and damage times, respectively. Our predictors, based on routine chat times and online social network inputs, identified future cyber offenders and victims within 2 months. Furthermore, we predicted the hours and days of their offenses and damages within a week. Extraction of routine chat times and online social networks from chat data can help predict future cyber offenders and victims. Our cyber offense and damage time predictor could help prevent future cyber offenses and damages and promote a safer cyberspace for everyone. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Cyber offenders and victims; Predicting offense and damage time; Routine activity theory; Social contagion,Anomaly detection; Crime; Damage detection; Online systems; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Anomaly detection; Cybe offender and victim; Cyberspaces; Damage time; Network activities; Online users; Predicting offense and damage time; Routine activity theories; Social contagion; Unsupervised machine learning; article; extraction; human; offender; online social network; outlier detection; supervised machine learning; victim; Forecasting,,,,,"CyberAgent , Inc.; CyberAgent, Inc., (akblab-0005)","Funding text 1: Kenji Yokotani received funding through a grant ( akblab-0005 ) from CyberAgent , Inc., the company that operates the online chat platform Pigg Party. ; Funding text 2: The present study was funded by CyberAgent, Inc.

With children increasingly interacting with these tools, it is imperative for researchers to scrutinise the safety of LLMs, especially for applications that could lead to serious outcomes, such as online child safety queries. In this paper, the efficacy of LLMs for online grooming prevention is explored both for identifying and avoiding grooming through advice generation, and the impact of prompt design on model performance is investigated by varying the provided context and prompt specificity. In results reflecting over 6,000 LLM interactions, we find that no models were clearly appropriate for online grooming prevention, with an observed lack of consistency in behaviours, and potential for harmful answer generation, especially from open-source models. We outline where and how models fall short, providing suggestions for improvement, and identify prompt designs that heavily altered model performance in troubling ways, with findings that can be used to inform best practice usage guides.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",advice generation; large language models; online child safety; online grooming detection; prompt design; prompt engineering,Safety engineering; Advice generation; Child safety; General publics; Language model; Large language model; Modeling performance; Online child safety; Online grooming detection; Prompt design; Prompt engineering; Computational linguistics,,,,,"University of Bristol; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (EP/S022937/1)",The authors wish to acknowledge and thank the financial support of the UKRI (Grant ref EP/S022937/1) and the University of Bristol.,"Abdelghani R., Wang Y.-H., Yuan X., Wang T., Lucas P., Sauzeon H., Oudeyer P.-Y., GPT-3-driven pedagogical agents to train children's curious question-asking skills, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 1-36, (2023); Bengio Y., Ducharme R., Vincent P., A neural probabilistic language model, Advances in neural information processing systems, 13, (2000); Brade S., Wang B., Sousa M., Oore S., Grossman T., Promptify: Text-to-image generation through interactive prompt exploration with large language models, Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, pp. 1-14, (2023); Brown T., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J.D., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Askell A., Et al., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in neural information processing systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Chang E.Y., Prompting large language models with the socratic method, 2023 IEEE 13th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC).

Based on this data, we leveraged a human-centered machine learning approach to create sexual risk detection classifiers for youth social media conversations. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forest models outperformed in identifying sexual risks at the conversation-level (AUC=0.88), and CNN outperformed at the message-level (AUC=0.85). We also trained classifiers to detect the severity risk level (i.e., safe, low, medium-high) of a given message with CNN outperforming other models (AUC=0.88). A feature analysis yielded deeper insights into patterns found within sexually safe versus unsafe conversations. We found that contextual features (e.g., age, gender, and relationship type) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) contributed the most for accurately detecting sexual conversations that made youth feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Our analysis provides insights into the important factors and contextual features that enhance automated detection of sexual risks within youths' private conversations. As such, we make valuable contributions to the computational risk detection and adolescent online safety literature through our human-centered approach of collecting and ground truth coding private social media conversations of youth for the purpose of risk classification.  © 2023 ACM.",adolescents online safety; deep learning; machine learning; sexual risk detection; youth online risks,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; E-learning; Feature extraction; Forestry; Learning systems; Random forests; Safety engineering; Social networking (online); Adolescent online safety; Contextual feature; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Risk detections; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Youth online risk; Risk assessment,,,,,,,"National Center for Missing Exploited Children, (2020); Agha Z., Chatlani N., Razi A., Wisniewski P., Towards Conducting Responsible Research with Teens and Parents Regarding Online Risks, Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Honolulu, HI, USA) (CHI EA '20), pp. 1-8, (2020); Ali S., Razi A., Kim S., Alsoubai A., Gracie J., De Choudhury M., Wisniewski P.J., Stringhini G., Understanding the Digital Lives of Youth: Analyzing Media Shared within Safe Versus Unsafe Private Conversations on Instagram, (2022); Alsoubai A., Caddle X.V., Doherty R., Taylor Koehler A., Sanchez E., De Choudhury M., Wisniewski P.J., MOSafely, Is That Sus?

The biggest drawback is the lack of tools focused on the automatic prevention of this risk. This paper proposes seven Behavioral Features (BFs) to be used for early grooming detection. A detailed study is conducted to understand the background that allows these features to contribute to tasks of early classification. Besides, we introduce the Behavioral Feature-Profile Specific Representation (BF-PSR) framework as an extension of the well-known Profile Specific Representation (PSR) framework to properly employ the proposed behavioral features. Experimental results reveal that our proposal outperforms all the concurrent methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance in the area of early grooming detection. Specifically, the new BF-PSR framework achieves a gain of more than 40% in effectiveness over five competitors when only 10% of the conversations’ content is available, thus it shows a substantial advantage to allow the early detection of grooming; besides, it maintains a similar gain in effectiveness as more data arrives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ behavioral features for the early detection of grooming. Furthermore, we have assembled two new datasets called PJZ and PJZC to mitigate the lack of data in the grooming detection area. Both sets are publicly available for download aimed at fostering further researches. Additional experiments reveal that our BF-PSR framework outperforms all of the state-of-the-art methods when processing these new datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioral features; Classification with partial information; Early text classification; Online grooming detection,Feature extraction; Social networking (online); Text processing; Additional experiments; Behavioral features; Classification with partial information; Early text classification; Feature profiles; Online grooming detection; Partial information; State-of-the-art methods; State-of-the-art performance; Young peoples; Classification (of information),,,,,"Brazilian Coordination for Improvement of Higher Level Personnel, (001); Brazilian National Council for Supporting Research, (130384/2020-8); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2016/17078-0, 2018/05714-5, 2020/07200-9); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This research was supported by FAPESP (São Paulo State Research Foundation), Brazil [grants 2020/07200-9 , 2018/05714-5 and 2016/17078-0 ], CAPES (Brazilian Coordination for Improvement of Higher Level Personnel), Brazil [grant 001 ] and CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Supporting Research) [grant 130384/2020-8 ].","Escalante H.J., Villatoro-Tello E., Garza S.E., Lpez-Monroy A.P., Montes-y Gmez M., Villaseor-Pineda L., Early detection of deception and aggressiveness using profile-based representations, Expert Syst.

Through a comparative analysis of various machine learning models, including traditional approaches and deep learning architectures, the study evaluates their effectiveness in accurately detecting and categorizing crime-related text data. The performance of the models is assessed using rigorous evaluation metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), to provide insights into their discriminative power and reliability. The findings reveal that machine learning frameworks, particularly the deep learning model, consistently outperform conventional machine learning approaches, highlighting the potential of advanced neural network architectures in crime analysis tasks. The implications of these findings for law enforcement agencies and researchers are discussed, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance crime prevention and intervention efforts. Furthermore, avenues for future research are identified, including the integration of multiple data sources and the exploration of interpretability and explainability of machine learning models in crime analysis problem. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the field of crime analysis problem and underscores the importance of leveraging innovative computational approaches to address complex societal challenges. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

It highlights the importance of detecting child predators making advantage of machine learning and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The proposed system includes three modules: the user, training module, and cyber system, and uses SVM for image and text classification. The system aims to protect children from sexual abuse by detecting and reporting damaging comments and posts made by predators on social media platforms. Existing systems use various classification algorithms, while the proposed system offers higher accuracy with the use of SVM. The system's function involves receiving input from users, going through posts and comments, classifying messages and pictures, and forwarding reports to cyber admins for further action.

One of the most attracting ones is streaming. Users may broadcast part of their daily lives to thousands of others world-wide and interact with them in real-time. Unfortunately, this feature is reportedly exploited for grooming. In this work, we provide the first in-depth analysis of this problem for social live streaming services. More precisely, using a dataset that we collected, we identify predatory behaviours and grooming on chats that bypassed the moderation mechanisms of the LiveMe, the service under investigation. Beyond the traditional text approaches, we also investigate the relevance of emojis in this context, as well as the user interactions through the gift mechanisms of LiveMe. Finally, our analysis indicates the possibility of grooming towards minors, showing the extent of the problem in such platforms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Emoji; LDA; Online grooming; Social networks; Text analysis,Computers; Daily lives; Emoji; In-depth analysis; Large-scale analysis; LDA; Live streaming; Online grooming; Real- time; Social network; Text analysis; Social networking (online),,,,,"Nvidia; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (830929, 832735); European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), as part of the projects CyberSection 4Europe (https://www.cybersec4europe.eu) (Grant Agreement No. 830929) and LOCARD (https://locard.eu) (Grant Agreement No. 832735).

Over the last few years, the rate of online grooming has seen a massive increase along with an increase in the number of teenage users. The proposed system, Prevention of Emotional Entrapment of Children (PEEC), consists of an age detection module using Deep Neural Network (DNN) as well as a grooming detection module using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to monitor the conversations of only those users who come under the category of minor (below 18). The resultant system gave an accuracy of 84% for age detection and 91% for grooming detection. © 2021 IEEE.",child harassment; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA); Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC); Online grooming; paedophilia,Deep neural networks; Statistics; Support vector machines; Child harassment; Detection modules; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Linguistic inquiry and word count; Online grooming; Pedophilia; Pressung; Social media; Support vectors machine; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Bretschneider U., Wohner T., Peters R., Detecting Online Harassment in Social Networks; Williams R., Elliott I.A., Beech A.R., Identifying sexual grooming themes used by internet sex offenders, Deviant Behavior; Zuo Z., Li J., Anderson P., Yang L., Grooming detection using fuzzy-rough feature selection and text classification, Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); Jonsson L.S., Fredlund C., Priebe G., Wadsby M., Svedin C.G., Online sexual abuse of adolescents by a perpetrator met online: A cross-sectional study, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, (); Dombrowski S.C., LeMasney J.W., Ahia C.E., Dickson S.A., Protecting children from online sexual predators:technological, psychoeduca-tional, and legal considerations, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, (); Gupta A., Kumaraguru P., Sureka A., Characterizing Pedophile Conversations on the Internet Using Online Grooming; Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics; Van Loo De J., De Pauw G., Daelemans W., Text-based age and gender prediction for online safety monitoring, International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics (IJCSDF); Tam J., Martell C.H., Age detection in chat, Ieee International Conference on Semantic Computing; Pentel A., Effect of different feature types on age based classification of short texts, Th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA), Corfu; Ashcroft M., Kaati L., Meyer M., A step towards detecting online grooming-identifying adults pretending to be children, European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference, Manchester; Pandya A., Oussalah M., Monachesi P., Kostakos P., Loven L., On the use of urls and hashtags in age prediction of twitter users, Ieee International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI), Salt Lake City, Ut; Guimaraes R.G., Rosa R.L., De Gaetano D., Rodriguez D.Z., Bressan G., Age groups classification in social network using deep learning, Ieee Access; Adams P.H., Martell C.H., Topic detection and extraction in chat, Ieee International Conference on Semantic Computing; Vartapetiance A., Gillam L., Our little secret"": Pinpointing potential predators, Security Informatics; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET); Anderson P., Zuo Z., Yang L., Qu Y., An intelligent online grooming detection system using ai technologies, Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); Cardei C., Rebeda T., Detecting sexual predators in chats using behavioral features and imbalanced learning, Natural Language Engineering; Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, Th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), Porto, Portugal; Munoz F., Isaza G., Castillo L., Smartseccop: Smart cyber-grooming detection using natural language processing and convolutional neural networks, Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Th International Conference; Zambrano P., Torres J., Tello-Oquendo L., Jacome R., Benalcazar M.E., Andrade R., Fuertes W., Technical mapping of the grooming anatomy using machine learning paradigms: An information security approach, Ieee Access; Perverted-justice.com-the Largest and Best Anti-Predator Organization Online; Non-Grooming Conversations; Abusive and Sexual Conversations between Adults",,Mallenahalli N.; Bhattacharya A.; Senatore S.; Negi A.; Hirose A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Mahindra University,"2021 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence, ICETCI 2021",25 August 2021 through 27 August 2021,"Virtual, Hyderabad",173182.0,,978-166541559-0,,,English,"Proc.

This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Data driven technique; Large-scale problem; Machine learning methods; Online behavior; Social interactions; Social media datum; Social structure; Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms,,,,,,,"Wang J., Iannotti R.J., Nansel T.R., School bullying among US adolescents: Physical, verbal, relational and cyber, Journal of Adolescent Health, 45, pp. 368-375, (2009); Herring S.C., Cyber violence: Recognizing and resisting abuse in online environments, Asian Women, 14, pp. 187-212, (2002); Boyd D., It’S Complicated, (2014); Donath J.S., Identity and deception in the virtual community, Communities in Cyberspace, 1996, pp. 29-59, (1999); Shachaf P., Ha N., Beyond vandalism: Wikipedia trolls, Journal of Information Science, 36, pp. 357-370, (2010); Cheng J., Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil C., Leskovec J., Antisocial behavior in online discussion communities, CoRR, (2015); Corcoran L., Guckin C.M., Prentice G., Cyberbullying or cyber aggression?: A review of existing definitions of cyber-based peer-to-peer aggression, Societies, 5, 2, pp. 245-255, (2015); Whitney I., Smith P.K., A survey of the nature and extent of bullying in junior/middle and secondary schools, Educational Research, 35, 1, pp. 3-25, (1993); Farrington D.P., Understanding and preventing bullying, Crime and Justice, pp. 381-458, (1993); Patchin J.W., Hinduja S., Cyberbullying Prevention and Response: Expert Perspectives, (2012); Kowalski R.M., Limber S.P., Agatston P.W., Cyberbullying: Bullying in The Digital Age, (2012); Smith P.K., Mahdavi J., Carvalho M., Fisher S., Russell S., Tippett N., Cyberbullying: Its nature and impact in secondary school pupils, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 49, 4, pp. 376-385, (2008); Tokunaga R.S., Following you home from school: A critical review and synthesis of research on cyberbullying victimization, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, 3, pp. 277-287, (2010); Dordolo N., The role of power imbalance in cyberbullying, Inkblot: The Undergraduate J.

Not only is there challenges towards determining the authenticity of people, but also with analyzing the data that forms part of the communications. These data are of heterogeneous type and include photos, videos and sound. Furthermore, most social media platforms are operating in an uncontrolled environment. Any person can contribute content and take part. Even though age restrictions do exist there are no enforcement of these laws and honesty of the public is expected. This is dangerous for minors specifically as they are either unaware of the dangers or not mature enough to be responsible for their actions online. Online predators are aware of this fact and targeting this group specifically. This paper presents work-in-progress towards developing an intelligent Identity Deception Indicator (IDI). It is envisaged that this work could eventually assists authorities in doing large-scale observation on publicly available social media platforms, such as Twitter. Of particular interest are those personas whose behavior and online content does not fit with the age group they are conversing with. © 2015 IEEE.",Big Data; Cyber-security; Data Science; Identity deception; Social media,Artificial intelligence; Social networking (online); Cyber security; Data Science; Deception detection; Identity deception; On-line contents; Science experiments; Social media; Social media platforms; Big data,,,,,,,"Vrij A., Guidelines to Catch A Liar, (2004); Tsikerdekis M., Zeadally S., Detecting and Preventing Online Identity Deception in Social Networking Services, Internet Computing, IEEE, 19, pp. 41-49, (2015); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring high-level features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, pp. 108-120, (2014); Laney D., 3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity and Variety, (2001); Cai L., Zhu Y., The Challenges of Data Quality and Data Quality Assessment in the Big Data Era, Data Science Journal, 14, (2015); Assuncao M.D., Calheiros R.N., Bianchi S., Netto M.A., Buyya R., Big Data computing and clouds: Trends and future directions, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 79, pp. 3-15, (2015); Ali-Ud-Din Khan M., Uddin M.F., Gupta N., Seven V's of Big Data understanding Big Data to extract value, American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE Zone 1), 2014 Zone 1 Conference of the, pp. 1-5, (2014); Han R., Jia Z., Gao W., Tian X., Wang L., Benchmarking Big Data Systems: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions, (2015); Kierkegaard S., Cybering, online grooming and ageplay, Computer Law & Security Review, 24, pp. 41-55, (2008); Liccardi I., Bulger M., Abelson H., Weitzner D.J., Mackay W., Can apps play by the COPPA Rules?, Privacy, Security and Trust (PST), 2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on, pp. 1-9, (2014); Peersman C., Daelemans W., Van Vaerenbergh L., Predicting age and gender in online social networks, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Search and Mining User-generated Contents, pp. 37-44, (2011); O'Keeffe G.S., Clarke-Pearson K., The impact of social media on children, adolescents, and families, Pediatrics, 127, pp. 800-804, (2011); Hancock J.T., Thom-Santelli J., Ritchie T., Deception and design: The impact of communication technology on lying behavior, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 129-134, (2004); Alowibdi J.S., Buy U.A., Philip S.Y., Ghani S., Mokbel M., Deception detection in Twitter, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 5, pp. 1-16, (2015); Alowibdi J.S., Buy U., Yu P.S., Stenneth L., Detecting Deception in Online Social Networks, Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on, pp. 383-390, (2014); Guillory J., Hancock J.T., The effect of Linkedin on deception in resumes, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 15, pp. 135-140, (2012); Wang G.A., Chen H., Xu J.J., Atabakhsh H., Automatically detecting criminal identity deception: An adaptive detection algorithm, Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, IEEE Transactions on, 36, pp. 988-999, (2006); Van Der Walt E., Eloff J.H.P., Protecting minors on social media platforms - A Big Data Science experiment, The HPI Cloud Symposium ""operating the Cloud, (2015); Schwartz H.A., Eichstaedt J.C., Kern M.L., Dziurzynski L., Ramones S.M., Agrawal M., Et al., Personality, gender, and age in the language of social media: The open-vocabulary approach, PloS One, 8, (2013); SAP HANA predictive analytics library, SAP HANA Platform SPS 10, Vol. Document Revision 1.0, (2015)",,Tran Q.-N.; Deligiannidis L.; Arabnia H.R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,American Council on Science and Education,"International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, CSCI 2015",7 December 2015 through 9 December 2015,Las Vegas,119673.0,,978-146739795-7,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

This work is important for a number of reasons: the increasing number of the Internet users across the globe, the increasing number of social media, increasing in the number and types of crime on the Internet, and the crime of sexual abuse in children impacts both physically and physiologically. Online grooming is the most reported suspected Internet activities in 2009-2010 according to Child Exploitation and Online Protection, which is a part of the UK's Home Office Serious Organized Crime agency. Around 160 online script conversations are analyzed to determine characteristics of a grooming conversation. Those scripts are obtained randomly from http://www.perverted-justice.com and www.literotika.com. The characteristics are divided into 20 types. The scripts are divided into two sets: 100 scripts for the training set and 59 scripts for the testing set. As the results, five most relevant grooming characteristics are identified from the paired t-test, and a logistic model is established on this basis. The model is evaluated using the testing data set, and the results show that the model has relatively good performance with 95% accuracy, 96% true positive, 4% false positive, 93% true negative, and 7% false negative. © 2015 The Authors.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors' classifiers. Besides, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method, which classifies a conversation using the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 textual conversations of which 105 are grooming, and 45 are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and k-NN can identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.",Grooming classifier; K-nearest neighbors; Online child grooming; Support vector machine,,,,,,,,"Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Whittle H., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A., Collings G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns, Aggression and violent behavior, 18, 1, pp. 62-70, (2013); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869, (2011); Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Leatherman A., Text mining and cybercrime, Text Mining: Applications and Theory, (2010); Mitchell K.J., Finkelhor D., Wolak J., Police posing as juveniles online to catch sex offenders: Is it working?, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17, 3, pp. 241-267, (2005); Briggs P., Simon W.T., Simonsen S., An exploratory study of internet-initiated sexual offenses and the chat room sex offender: Has the internet enabled a new typology of sex offender?, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, (2010); Webster S., Davidson J., Bifulco A., Gottschalk P., Pham C.V.T., Grove-Hills J., Turley C., Tompkins C., Ciulla S., Milazzo V., Schimmenti A., Craparo G., European online grooming project, (2012); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, Journal of advances in information technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Babaoglu I., Findik O., Ulker E., A comparison of feature selection models utilizing binary particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in determining coronary artery disease using support vector machine, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 4, pp. 3177-3183, (2010); Acharya U.R., Ng E., Tan J.H., Sree S.V., Thermography based breast cancer detection using texture features and support vector machine, Journal of medical systems, 36, 3, pp. 1503-1510, (2012); Horng S.J., Su M.Y., Chen Y.H., Kao T.W., Chen R.J., Lai J.L., Perkasa C.D., A novel intrusion detection system based on hierarchical clustering and support vector machines, Expert systems with Applications, 38, 1, pp. 306-313, (2011); O'Connel R.A., Typology of cybersex exploitation and online grooming process, (2014); Gupta V., Lehal G., A survey of text summarization extractive techniques, Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence, 2, 3, pp. 258-268, (2010); Christianni N., Shawe Taylor J., An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, (2000); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning, (2008); Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, Journal of advances in information technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Powers D.M., Evaluation: From precision, recall, and F-measure to roc, informedness, markedness & correlation, Journal of Machine Learning Technologies, 2, 1, pp. 37-63, (2011); Justice P.; Wollis M., A linguistic analysis of online predator grooming, (2011); Bergen E., Davidson J., Schulz A., Schuhmann P., Johansson A., The effects of using identity deception and suggesting secrecy on the outcomes of adult-adult and adult-child or-adolescent online sexual interactions, Victims and Offenders, 9, pp. 276-298, (2014)","F.E.

The use by minors of social networks applications, and games that are connected to the internet offer the possibility of communication, can make them exposed to various threats. One of the most troubling threats is sexual abuse. Thus the objective of this project is to create a model for classifying messages, as normal or dangerous, according to the risk they present to the minor. In addition to integrating the developed model with a project that analyzes the behavior of minors in a social network (Facebook), and calculates the risk of the minor be a victim of sexual abuse. Finally, we use the model in the classification of messages obtained from a server of the game Minecraft, quite popular among children. © 2018, © 2018 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",children and teenagers protection; clustering messages; messages exchange classification; minecraft; social media,,,,,,,,"Araujo Leite J.L., Mineracao de textos do twitter utilizando tecnicas de classificação, (2015); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predatorsProceedings of the 3rd workshop in computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, (2012); Carletta J., Assessing agreement on classification tasks: The Kappa statistic, Computational Linguistics, 22, 2, pp. 249-254, (1996); Cheng Y., Chen K., Sun H., Zhang Y., Tao F., Data and knowledge mining with big data towards smart production, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 9, pp. 1-13, (2018); de Souza Viana T.S., de Oliveira M., da Silva T.L.C., Junior M.S.R.F., Goncalves E.J.T., Textual analysis for the protection of children and teenagers in social media–classification of inappropriate messages for children and teenagersProceedings of the 19th international conference on enterprise information systems–Volume 2: ICEIS, (2017); Duan L., Binbasioglu M., An ensemble framework for community detection, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 5, pp. 1-5, (2017); Duan L., Xu L., Business intelligence for enterprise systems: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 3, pp. 679-687, (2012); Falcao Jr M.S.R., Goncalves E.J.T., da Silva T.L.C., de Oliveira M., Behavioral analysis for child protection in social network through data mining and multiagent systemsProceedings of the 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems–Volume 2: ICEIS, (2016); Fayyad U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro G., Smyth P., Advances in knowledge discovery and data miningChapter from data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview, (1996); Hall M., Frank E., Holmes G., Pfahringer B., Reutemann P., Witten I.H., The WEKA data mining software: An update, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11, 1, pp. 10-18, (2009); Macwan S., inz Grzegorz Filcek D., Web mining against pedophilia, International Education and Research Journal, 3, 5, (2017); McCallum A., Nigam K., AAAI-98 workshop on learning for text categorization, (1998); Metsis V., Androutsopoulos I., Paliouras G., Spam filtering with Naive Bayes–which Naive Bayes?, (2006); Moreno-Sandoval L.G., Beltran-Herrera P., Vargas-Cruz J.A., Sanchez-Barriga C., Pomares-Quimbaya A., Alvarado-Valencia J.A., Garcia-Diaz J.C., CSL: A combined Spanish lexicon–resource for polarity classification and sentiment analysisProceedings of the 19th international conference on enterprise information systems–Volume 1: ICEIS, (2017); Morris C., Hirst G., CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), (2012); Tan P.N., Introduction to data mining, (2006); Velmurugan T., Santhanam T., Computational complexity between k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms for normal and uniform distributions of data points, Journal of Computer Science, 6, pp. 363-368, (2010); Yuan R., Li Z., Guan X., Xu L., An SVM-based machine learning method for accurate internet traffic classification, Information Systems Frontiers, 12, 2, pp. 149-156, (2010)","M. de Oliveira; Universidade Federal do Ceará, Quixadá, Brazil; email: marcos.oliveira@ufc.br",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,,,,23270012,,,,English,J.

Most prior linguistic and psychological research into online sexual abuse analyses transcripts involving adult decoys posing as children. In contrast, our data comprise genuine online conversations between the offender and 20 victims. Using move analysis (Swales 1981, 1990), we explore the offender’s numerous presented personas. The offender’s use of rhetorical moves is investigated, as is the extent to which the frequency and structure of these moves contribute to and discriminate between the various online personas he adopts. We find from eight frequently adopted personas that two divergent identity positions emerge: the sexual pursuer/aggressor, performed by the majority of his online personas, and the friend/boyfriend, performed by a single persona. Analysis of the offender’s self-describing assertives suggests this distinctive persona shares most attributes with the offender’s ‘home identity’. This article importantly raises the question of whether move analysis might be useful in identifying the ‘offline persona’ in cases where offenders are known to operate multiple online personas in the pursuit of child victims. © Oxford University Press 2018.",,,,,,,,,"Acar K.V., Sexual extortion of children in cyberspace, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 10, pp. 110-126, (2016); Bhatia V.K., Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, (1993); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behaviour in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse and Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Boon A., Identifying moves in an IMCD session, Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University, 21, pp. 219-235, (2013); Boon A., Learner Support and Discovery in A Virtual Non-Judgmental Environment, (2015); Bucholtz M., Why be normal?

However, Social Networking Sites is providing opportunities for cyberbullying activities. Cyberbullying is harassing or insulting a person by sending messages of hurting or threatening nature using electronic communication. Cyberbullying poses significant threat to physical and mental health of the victims. Detection of cyberbullying and the provision of subsequent preventive measures are the main courses of action to combat cyberbullying. The proposed method is an effective method to detect cyberbullying activities on social media. The detection method can identify the presence of cyberbullying terms and classify cyberbullying activities in social network such as Flaming, Harassment, Racism and Terrorism, using Fuzzy logic and Genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the system is increased using Fuzzy rule set to retrieve relevant data for classification from the input. In the proposed method Genetic algorithm is also used, for optimizing the parameters and to obtain precise output. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A number of studies have already addressed this issue, however, the data used in previous research did not properly represent the real chats found in multiplayer online games. To address this issue, we obtained real chat data from MovieStarPlanet, a massively multiplayer online game for children. The research described in this paper aimed to detect predatory behaviors in the chats using machine learning methods. In order to achieve a high accuracy on this task, extensive preprocessing was necessary. We describe three different strategies for data selection and preprocessing, and extensively compare the performance of different learning algorithms on the different data sets and features. © 2015 IEEE.",Chat; data mining; game data; natural language processing (NLP); preprocessing; sexual predator; text classification,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Chat; game data; NAtural language processing; preprocessing; sexual predator; Text classification; Learning algorithms,,,,,,,"Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Leatherman A., Text Mining and Cybercrime, pp. 149-164, (2010); Sonia L., Leslie H., Anke G., Kjartan O., Risks and Safety on the Internet: The Perspective of European Children: Full Findings and Policy Implications from the EU Kids Online Survey of 9-16 Year Olds and Their Parents in 25 Countries, (2011); Morris C., Identifying Online Sexual Predators by SVM Classification with Lexical and Behavioral Features, (2013); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proc. 3rd Workshop Comput.

Existing technology and non-technology based intervention programs do not provide assistance at the onset of abuse. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a mobile phone application that can detect digital dating abuse. As a step toward this goal we are investigating the use of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to flag text messages as abusive or non-abusive in the context of dating abuse. Due to the lack of a publicly available dataset that could be used to create training and testing sets for the classifiers, we first had to create and validate a dataset of abusive text messages. This paper describes the dataset creation process and the results of an evaluation of different classification and feature extraction techniques used to detect abusive texts. © 2018 IEEE.",Classifiers; Dataset Creation And Validation; Digital Dating Abuse; Machine Learning,Artificial intelligence; Classifiers; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; mHealth; Natural language processing systems; Statistical tests; Creation process; Dataset Creation And Validation; Digital Dating Abuse; Feature extraction techniques; Intervention programs; Mobile phone applications; Natural languages; Training and testing; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"Stonard K.E., Bowen E., Walker K., Price S.A., They'll always find a way to get to you.

Especially among young people, social networks have become a part of everyday life and the cyberbullying problem has arisen as a result of hiding the credentials of people in cyberspace and reaching every level. In this study was carried out assays for the detection of cyberbullying. A total of 3469 reviews from Youtube were tagged as positive and negative, depending on whether have contained bullying. In the analyzes, the number of features of the data set was reduced to 10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 using the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR), ReliefF and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithms as feature selection algorithms, support vector machines (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), radial basis function (RBF) and logistic regression (LR) have been preferred as classification algorithms.

Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain set of “manually” elaborated conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples of humans’ interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Conversational agent; Cyber-pedophilia; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora; Natural language processing,Linguistics; Speech processing; Conversational agents; Cyber-pedophilia; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora; NAtural language processing; Conversational systems; Dialogue systems; Law enforcement officers; Natural languages; Natural language processing systems,,,,,"Language Technologies Thematic Network, (260178, 271622); Thematic Networks program; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Acknowledgments.

In addition, the sheer volume of cases involving the online sexual solicitation of minors makes it difficult for law enforcement to determine whether an offender is contact-driven vs. fantasy-driven. However, research shows that there are language-based differences between minors and contact-driven offenders vs. fantasy driven-offenders. Thus, we developed the Chat Analysis Triage Tool (CATT), a forensically sound investigative tool that, based on natural language processing methods, analyzes and compares chats between minors and contact-driven vs. non-contract driven offenders. Using an SVM classifier, we were successful in differentiating the classes based on character trigrams. In a matter of seconds, the existing algorithms provide an identification of an offender's risk level based on the likelihood of contact offending as inferred from the model, which assists law enforcement in their ability to triage and prioritize cases involving the sexual solicitation of minors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chat, machine learning; Child sexual exploitation; Digital forensics; Internet crimes against children; Linguistic inquiry and word count; Sexual solicitations","Adult; Algorithms; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Fantasy; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Internet; Linguistics; Natural Language Processing; Police; Software; Support Vector Machine; article; child; classifier; emergency health service; fantasy; female; human; human experiment; Internet; law enforcement; male; natural language processing; sexual crime; sexual exploitation; sound; adult; algorithm; child sexual abuse; diagnosis; fantasy; forensic science; linguistics; natural language processing; police; software; support vector machine",,,,,"Purdue Polytechnic Institute; Purdue University, PU","This project was funded through an internet grant, 2016 Purdue Polytechnic Institute Seed Grant program, at Purdue University.

The profiling methodology focuses on problematic paraphilic interests, involving illegal or non-consensual activities associated with the sexual victimisation of children. This work extends an earlier typal analysis carried out by Hammond et al. (2009. An examination of problematic paraphilic use of peer to peer facilities. In Advances in the analysis of online paedophile activity (pp. 65–73). Paris: MAPAP Project) in which a distinct problematic paraphilic typology was uncovered in the search behaviours of P2P users. The methodology described focuses on the subsequent development of a latent class model that underpins the operation of the profiling application. The composite profiling process is described. Finally, we discuss the prospective applications of this profiling process and the implications of our methodological design. We identify a series of recommendations for future research and for the design of profiling and risk appraisal processes with application to online CSEM offending behaviour. © 2016 National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers.",Child Sexual Exploitation Material; internet investigation; latent class analysis; paraphilia; peer-to-peer; profiling; risk assessment,child; disease carrier; France; human; Internet; model; risk assessment; sexual deviation; sexual exploitation,,,,,,,"Abel G.G., Becker J.V., Cunningham-Rathner J., Mittelman M., Rouleau J.L., Multiple paraphilic diagnoses among sex offenders, Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online, 16, 2, pp. 153-168, (1988); Abel G.G., Osborn C., The paraphilias: The extent and nature of sexually deviant and criminal behavior, Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 15, pp. 675-687, (1992); Alison L., Goodwill A., Almond L., van den Heuvel C., Winter J., Pragmatic solutions to offender profiling and behavioural investigative advice, Legal and Criminological Psychology, 15, 1, pp. 115-132, (2010); Blanchard R., Lykins A.D., Wherrett D., Kuban M.E., Cantor J.M., Blak T., Klassen P.E., Pedophilia, hebephilia, and the DSM-V, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38, 3, pp. 335-350, (2009); Calder M.C., Child sexual abuse and the internet: Tackling the new frontier, (2004); Canter D.V., Heritage R., A multivariate model of sexual offence behaviour: Developments in offender profiling, Journal of Forensic Psychiatry, 1, pp. 185-212, (1989); Canter D.V., Hughes D., Kirby S., Paedophilia: Pathology, criminality, or both?

However, as social networking has become widespread, certain people are finding illegal and unethical ways to use these communities as means for opening the door of inappropriate online activities. Thus, they are providing an open way for cybercrimes such as cyberbullying. In this paper, we deal with the aforementioned issue as a time series modelling methodology, aiming at the recognition of bullying patterns within the questions posed by a predator to his victims. Given a set of real world transcripts (i.e. the whole set of predator's questions), in which each question is numerically labelled in terms of severity, we first model each set of predator's questions as a time series. The next step is the main contribution of this paper, in terms of changing the representation scheme from time series data into symbolic representation. More specifically, inspired by the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) method, commonly used in computational biology for identifying conserved regions of similarity among raw molecular data, we represent the set of signals according to a SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) symbolic representation, transforming each signal into a symbol string. The main rationale behind this adoption lies to the fact that the collected cyberbullying data can be converted to string sequences via SAX conversion, which in turn can be aligned, thus revealing conserved temporal patterns or slight variations in the attacking strategies of the predators. Experimental results, based on the clustering improvement of the aforementioned data using the extracted patterns instead of the time series data, justify our claims. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such detrimental online behaviors. We propose a weakly supervised machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying using minimal effort and cost, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. The weak supervision is in the form of expert-provided small seed of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). To evaluate PVC, we perform extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three social media datasets: Twitter, Ask.fm, and Instagram. We illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the model by analyzing the identified conversations and key phrases by PVC. In addition, we demonstrate the distributions of bully and victim scores to examine the relationship between the tendencies of users to bully or to be victimized. We also perform fairness evaluation to analyze the potential for automated detection to be biased against particular groups. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,Computer crime; Health risks; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Automated detection; Data driven technique; Fairness evaluation; Model estimates; Qualitative experiments; Social interactions; Social structure; Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms,,,,,,,"Ashktorab Z., Vitak J., Designing cyberbullying mitigation and prevention solutions through participatory design with teenagers, Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3895-3905, (2016); Bellmore A., Calvin A.J., Xu J.-M., Zhu X., The five W’s of bullying on Twitter: who, what, why, where, and when, Comput Hum Behav, 44, pp. 305-314, (2015); Bifet A., Frank E., Sentiment knowledge discovery in Twitter streaming data, International Conference on Discovery Science, pp. 1-15, (2010); Boyd D., It’s complicated, (2014); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Mean birds: Detecting aggression and bullying on twitter, In: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference, (2017); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Measuring #gamergate: A tale of hate, sexism, and bullying, Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 1285-1290, (2017); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakili A., Hate is not binary: Studying abusive behavior of #gamergate on twitter, In: Proceedings of the 28Th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media, (2017); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., DeCristofaro E., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Detecting aggressors and bullies on Twitter.

Although it doesn't directly create some negative effects of traditional child prostitution like sexually transmitted diseases, it may provide future offenders and victims to the traditional crimes such as child prostitution and child sex tourism. Therefore, appropriate and effective prevention strategies for this heinous act should be introduced accordingly. In this respect, this article discuss the efficiency of current methods of detection and propose some futuristic methods such as metadata and content data analysis of VoIP communications by the private sector and the use of fully automated chatbots for undercover operations. The applicability of such new methods in real life heavily relies on legal amendments and requires further research on technical aspects in particular.",Crime prevention; Cyber crime; Law enforcement; Online child sexual abuse; VoIP; Webcam child prostitution,,,,,,,,"Acar K.V., Sexual Extortion of Children in Cyberspace, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 10, 2, (2016); Angga P.A., Fachri W.E., Elevanita A., Agushinta R.D., Design of chatbot with 3D avatar, voice interface, and facial expression, 2015 International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech), pp. 326-330, (2015); Bellovin S., Blaze M., Brickell E., Brooks C., Cerf V., Diffie W., Treichler J., Security implications of applying the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act to voice over IP, Information Technology Association of America, (2006); Brenner S.W., Cybercrime jurisdiction, Crime, Law and Social Change, 46, 4-5, pp. 189-206, (2006); Burnett K., Ng K.B., Park S., A comparison of the two traditions of metadata development, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 50, 13, (1999); Clark J., Why Artificial Intelligence is the answer to the greatest threat of 2017, cyber-hacking, Independent, (2017); Cohen-Almagor R., Confronting the Internet's Dark Side.

The detection of sexual predation is one of the most important and challenging tasks in our days. Using real-world data, we follow a time series modeling approach, in which predator’s posts (i. e. questions) are associated with numeric labels, according to the style of the attack (e. g. attempts for physical approach, grooming, retrieval of personal information, etc.). Upon modeling the domain as time series, in order to allow for forecasting the severity of a future question of a predator (i. e. the class label), a sliding window method was adopted. Two well-known methods that have been traditionally applied in time series problems, namely Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, were utilized for forecasting. Simultaneously, since text processing is almost certain to derive a large number of input features, an additional method for reducing dimensionality of the original dataset was applied, implemented with Singular Value Decomposition. We demonstrate that the use of SVM classifier is more appropriate for our data and we show that it is able to provide accurate results that surpass current state-of-the-art outcomes, by using both the original feature set as well as the reduced SVD dimensions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Computer crime; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Text processing; Time series; Personal information; Physical approaches; Sliding window methods; Social media platforms; State of the art; SVM classifiers; Time series forecasting; Time series modeling; Singular value decomposition,,,,,,,"Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop-Working Notes Papers, (2012); Kontostathis A., Reynolds K., Garron A., Edwards L., Detecting cyberbullying: Query terms and techniques, Proceedings of the 5Th Annual ACM Web Science Conference, pp. 195-204, (2013); Yin Z.X., Hong L., Davison B.D., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Detection of harassment on web 2. 0, CAW 2. 0 2009: Proceedings of the 1St Content Analysis in Web 2. 0, (2009); Dadvar M., De Jong F., Ordelman R., Trieschnigg D., Improved cyberbullying detection using gender information, Proceedings of the 12Th-Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop (DIR 2012), (2012); (2008); Kalman D., Asingularly valuable decomposition: The SVDof a matrix, College Math.

However, Social Networking Sites is providing opportunities for cyberbullying activities. Cyberbullying is harassing or insulting a person by sending messages of hurting or threatening nature using electronic communication. Cyberbullying poses significant threat to physical and mental health of the victims. Detection of cyberbullying and the provision of subsequent preventive measures are the main courses of action to combat cyberbullying. A cyberbully detection system to identify and classify cyberbullying activities such as Flaming, Harassment, Racism and Terrorism in Social network is proposed. Cyberbully detection is done using Levenshtein algorithm and classification of Cyberbully activity is carried out using Naïve Bayes classifier. © Copyright 2015 ACM.",Cyberbullying; Lavenshtein algorithm; Naïve Bayes classifier; Network security; Social network,Algorithms; Classification (of information); Health risks; Network security; Social networking (online); Sodium; Websites; Bayes Classifier; Cyber bullying; Cyberbully; Detection system; Electronic communications; Mental health; Preventive measures; Social networking sites; Computer crime,,,,,,,"Belsey B., (2013); Smith P.K., Mahdavi J., Carvalho M., Fisher S., Russell S., Tippett N., Cyberbullying: Its nature and impact in secondary school pupils, Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry, 49, pp. 376-385, (2012); Campbell M.A., Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?, Australian Journal of Guidance and Counselling, 15, pp. 68-76, (2011); Bastiaensens S., Vandebosch H., Poels K., Van Cleemput K., DeSmet A., De Bourdeaudhuij I., Cyberbullying on social network sites.
