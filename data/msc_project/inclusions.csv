The pivotal reason behind this phenomenon happens to be the ability of OSNs to provide a platform for users to connect with their family, friends, and colleagues. The information shared in social network and media spreads very fast, almost instantaneously which makes it attractive for attackers to gain information. Secrecy and surety of OSNs need to be inquired from various positions. There are numerous security and privacy issues related to the user’s shared information especially when a user uploads personal content such as photos, videos, and audios. The attacker can maliciously use shared information for illegitimate purposes. The risks are even higher if children are targeted. To address these issues, this paper presents a thorough review of different security and privacy threats and existing solutions that can provide security to social network users. We have also discussed OSN attacks on various OSN web applications by citing some statistics reports. In addition to this, we have discussed numerous defensive approaches to OSN security. Finally, this survey discusses open issues, challenges, and relevant security guidelines to achieve trustworthiness in online social networks. © 2021, The Author(s).",Cyber grooming; Cyberbullying; Online social network; Security and privacy; Social threats,,,,,,,,"Benson V., Saridakis G., Tennakoon H., Ezingeard J.N., The role of security notices and online consumer behaviour: an empirical study of social networking users, Int J Hum Comput Stud, 80, pp. 36-44, (2015); Fosso Wamba S., Akter S., Impact of Perceived Connectivity on Intention to Use Social Media: Modelling the Moderation Effects of Perceived Risk and Security, pp. 219-227, (2016); Sahoo S.R., Gupta B.B., Fake profile detection in multimedia big data on online social networks, Int J Inf Comput Secur, 12, 2-3, pp. 303-331, (2020); Bailey M., Cooke E., Jahanian F., Xu Y., Karir M A survey of botnet technology and defenses; Ahmed M., Mahmood A.N., Hu J., A survey of network anomaly detection techniques, J Netw Comput Appl, 60, pp. 19-31, (2016); Mislove A., Viswanath B., Gummadi K.P., Druschel P., You are who you know, .

As a consequence, online social deception (OSD) in SNSs has emerged as a serious threat in cyberspace, particularly for users vulnerable to such cyberattacks. Cyber attackers have exploited the sophisticated features of SNSs to carry out harmful OSD activities, such as financial fraud, privacy threat, or sexual/labor exploitation. Therefore, it is critical to understand OSD and develop effective countermeasures against OSD for building trustworthy SNSs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive survey, covering 1) the multidisciplinary concept of social deception; 2) types of OSD attacks and their unique characteristics compared to other social network attacks and cybercrimes; 3) comprehensive defense mechanisms embracing prevention, detection, and response (or mitigation) against OSD attacks along with their pros and cons; 4) datasets/metrics used for validation and verification; and 5) legal and ethical concerns related to OSD research. Based on this survey, we provide insights into the effectiveness of countermeasures and the lessons learned from the existing literature. We conclude our survey with in-depth discussions on the limitations of the state-of-the-art and suggest future research directions in OSD research. © 2013 IEEE.","cyberattacks; defense; detection, and response; Online social deception; online social networks; prevention; security; social media",Computer crime; Network security; Surveys; Defense mechanism; Effectiveness of countermeasures; Ethical concerns; Future research directions; On-line communication; Social network services; State of the art; Validation and verification; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Abutair H., Belghith A., Alahmadi S., CBR-PDS: A case-based reasoning phishing detection system, J.

Of particular concern are interactions between minors and adults with predatory intentions. Unfortunately, previous research on online sexual grooming has relied on time-intensive manual annotation by domain experts, limiting both the scale and scope of possible interventions. This work explores the possibility of detecting predatory behaviours with accuracy comparable to expert annotators using machine learning (ML). Using a dataset of 6771 chat messages sent by child sex offenders, labelled by two of the authors who are forensic psychology experts, we study how well can deep learning algorithms identify eleven known predatory behaviours. We find that the best-performing ML models are consistent but not on par with expert annotation. We therefore consider a system where an expert annotator validates the ML algorithms outputs. The combination of human decision-making and computer efficiency yields precision - but not recall - comparable to manual annotation, while taking only a fraction of the time needed by a human annotator. Our findings underscore the promise of ML as a tool for assisting researchers in this area, but also highlight the current limitations in reliably detecting online sexual exploitation using ML.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",chat logs; Child sexual exploitation; machine learning; natural language processing; online grooming,Decision making; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Chat logs; Child sexual exploitation; Communication strategy; Language processing; Machine-learning; Manual annotation; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online grooming; Predatory behavior; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Leverhulme Centre, (RC-2015-067); University of Liverpool, UoL, (9972)","Funding text 1: Given the nature of our topic, ethical approval was sought for the initial data collection and manual labelling of the Perverted Justice corpus.

The reviewed approaches are successful in most of the situations but have their own weaknesses. As such consideration is required for all stakeholders within the child protection arena. The utmost duty to protect children lies with all, irrespective of whether the abuse occurred on or offline. The reporting and intervention on child abuse cases were based on the community, as this was mostly offline perpetrated by parents or caregivers. However, with the advent of technology and the increasing use of the internet by children for several reasons, it has shifted most abuses from offline to online. The law enforcement authorities such as police plays a vital role in protecting children online and can apply different approaches compared to other agencies such as Social Services, Health, and Education. However, Government recommendations for a joint working response mean that all child-protected agencies need to work together in the process of protecting children (HM Government in Working together to safeguard children: a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, Department for Children, Schools, and Families, London, 2010). However, with the emergence of COVID-19 and the high reliance on the internet by children, it meant that the police must adapt to the changes and rely on advanced technologies such as AI. The UK Police force is stretched due to a lack of financial and human resources, which means that alternative intervention methods are applied in monitoring and attacking online child abuse. This chapter challenges the use of AI unilaterally in predicting and identifying online abuse as opposed to face-to-face investigation and intervention. Though AI can be helpful, it has limitations that can impact on protecting children online as discussed in this chapter. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Child protection; Child safety; Online abuse,,,,,,,,"Baidoo L, Zakrison TL, Feldmeth G, Lindau ST, Tung EL, Domestic violence police reporting and resources during the 2020 COVID-19 stay-at-home order in Chicago, Illinois, JAMA Netw Open, 4, 9, (2021); Beech M, COVID-19 pushes up Internet use 70% and streaming more than 12%, first figures reveal, (2022); Bollen J, Mao H, Zeng X-J, Twitter mood predicts the stock market, J Comput Sci, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Bouma H, Et al., Automatic analysis of online image data for law enforcement agencies by concept detection and instance search, Proceedings of the SPIE 10441 counterterrorism crime fighting forensics and surveillance technologies, (2017); Bromfield LM, Holzer PJ, A national approach for child protection: project report.

For that reason, the AI-powered child protection system helps protect children from modern cyber-attacks while offering parents more control over their children. Keyloggers, keystroke and mouse movement loggers help to collect data and can record user behaviour and find patterns. Furthermore, the use of those records is able to detect children's improper behaviour and reveal children's emotional states. Behavioral Data Extractor and Risk Analysis systems can analyze huge numbers of URLs and web content recorded by proxy, as well as application usage and screen times collected by background service. The Smart Resource Restricter is designed to help parents and children navigate the web safely and appropriately. The research can identify and prevent child predators. Indeed, cyberbullying and phishing attacks cross many boundaries, causing great harm to the community. It blocks outside threats and notifies parents of sexual and other online predators that often target children. The PandaGuardian successfully achieved its goal with the assistance of different algorithms and the respective outcomes. The model evaluation report, which compares all the methods, is a guardian companion. Parents could get assistance in order to safeguard their children from the day-to-day evolving cyber threats.  © 2021 IEEE.",Artificial intelligent; Behavioral data extractor; Child protection; Cyberbullying; Human feedback ex-tractor; Keylogger; Mouse movement; Phishing; Random forest; Smart resource restrictor,Behavioral research; Crime; Decision trees; Feedback; Mammals; Network security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Artificial intelligent; Behavioral data; Behavioral data extractor; Child protections; Cyber bullying; Data extractors; Human feedback ex-tractor; Mouse movements; Phishing; Random forests; Smart resource restrictor; Computer crime,,,,,,,"Acien A., Morales A., Monaco J.V., Vera-Rodriguez R., Fierrez J., TypeNet: Deep Learning Keystroke Biometrics, (2021); Ahmed A.A.E., Traore I., A new biometrie technology based on mouse dynamics, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 4, 3, pp. 165-179, (2007); Antal M., Egyed-Zsigmond E., Intrusion detection using mouse dynamics, IET Biometrics, 8, 5, pp. 285-294, (2019); Abdallah T., Iglesia B., URL-based web page classification: With ngram language models, International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering, and Knowledge Management, pp. 19-33, (2014); Pericherla I.S., A Study of Machine Learning Approaches to Detect Cyberbullying, (2021); Ramos J., Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries, Proceedings of the First Instructional Conference on Machine Learning, 242, pp. 133-142, (2003); McCallum A., Nigam K., A comparison of event models for näive bayes text classification, AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, 752, 1, pp. 41-48, (1998); Shen C., Cai Z., Guan X., Continuous authentication for mouse dynamics: A pattern-growth approach, Proceedings of the International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks, (2012); Tan Y.X.M., Binder A., Roy A., Insights from curve fitting models in mouse dynamics authentication systems, 2017 IEEE Conference on Applications, Information and Network Security, AINS 2017, pp. 42-47, (2017); Pericherla S.I., A Study of Machine Learning Approaches to Detect Cyberbullying, (2021); Nivedha S., Gokulan S., Karthik C., Gopinath R., Et al., Improving Phishing URL Detection Using Fuzzy Association Mining, (2017); Gan G., Et al., Data Clustering Theory, Algorithms, and Applications, American Statistical Association and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, (2007); Vapnik V., The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory, (1995); Vapnik V., Statistical Learning Theory, (1998); Dumais S.T., Platt J., Heckerman D., Sahami M., Inductive learning algorithms and representations for text categorization, Proceedings of ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 148-155, (1998); Lu P., Jia F., Qie J., MEMS-based human-body pose classification and monitoring system for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Modern Electronics Technique, 40, 16, pp. 169-172+177, (2017); Araujo M., Et al., Com2: Fast Automatic Discovery of Temporal ('Comet') Communities, Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, LNCS, 8444, pp. 271-283, (2014); Jiang M., Et al., Catchsync: Catching Synchronized Behavior in Large Directed Graphs, Proc. 20th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf.

In this study, we propose an effective method for sexual predator identification in online chats based on two-stage classification. The purpose of the first stage is to distinguish predatory conversations from the normal ones while the second stage aims to tell apart between the predator user and the victim within a single predatory conversation. Finally, some unique predators are derived from the second stage result. We investigate several machine learning classifiers including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree with Bag of Words features using several different term weighting methods for this task. We also proposed two ensemble techniques to improve the classification task. The experiment results on PAN12 dataset show that our best method using soft voting based ensemble for first stage and Naive Bayes based method for the second stage obtained an F0.5-score of 0.9348, which would place as number one in the PAN12 competition ranking. © 2020 IEEE.",classification; cyber grooming; online chats; sexual predator,Biometrics; Classifiers; Decision trees; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Bag of words; Classification tasks; Ensemble methods; Ensemble techniques; K-nearest neighbors; Naive bayes; Soft voting; Term weighting; Logistic regression,,,,,,,"Britain G., Children and parents: Media use and attitudes report, Ofcom, (2013); Madigan S., Villani V., Azzopardi C., Laut D., Smith T., Temple J.R., Browne D., Dimitropoulos G., The prevalence of unwanted online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth: A meta-analysis, Journal of Adolescent Health, 63, 2, pp. 133-141, (2018); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, 2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC).

The main aim of this study is to examine the effects of the ABC-based feature selection algorithm on classification performance for cyberbullying, which has become a significant worldwide social issue in recent years. With this purpose, the classification performance of the proposed ABC-based feature selection method is compared with three different traditional methods such as information gain, ReliefF and chi square. Experimental results present that ABC-based feature selection method outperforms than three traditional methods for the detection of cyberbullying. The Macro averaged F_measure of the data set is increased from 0.659 to 0.8 using proposed ABC-based feature selection method. © 2020 The British Computer Society 2020.

This capability has many benefits, but it can also be used by malevolent individuals, i.e. predators. Anonymity exacerbates the problem. The motivation of our work is to help protect our children from this potentially hostile environment, without excluding them from utilizing its benefits. In our research, we aim to develop an online sexual predator identification system, designed to detect cybercrime related to child grooming. We will use AI techniques to analyze chat interactions available from different social networks. However, before any meaningful analysis can be carried out, chats must be pre-processed into a consistent and suitable format. This task poses challenges in itself. In this paper we show how different and diverse chat formats can be automatically normalized into a consistent text-based format that can be subsequently used for analysis. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Chat logs; Deep learning; Online predator identification,Computer crime; Pattern recognition; AI techniques; Cybercrime; Data preprocessing; Hostile environments; On-line interactions; Social media; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Online chat”; Dan L., Identifying Cyber Predators by Using Sentiment Analysis and Recurrent Neural Networks, (2018); Ebrahimi M., Automatic identification of online predators in chat logs by anomaly detection and deep learning, M.Comp.Sc.

This study aimed to solve this challenge through analyses of routine chat times and online social networks. We sampled more than 550,000 online users over 6 months. We also used unsupervised and supervised machine learning to predict cyber offenders and victims and their offense and damage times, respectively. Our predictors, based on routine chat times and online social network inputs, identified future cyber offenders and victims within 2 months. Furthermore, we predicted the hours and days of their offenses and damages within a week. Extraction of routine chat times and online social networks from chat data can help predict future cyber offenders and victims. Our cyber offense and damage time predictor could help prevent future cyber offenses and damages and promote a safer cyberspace for everyone. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Cyber offenders and victims; Predicting offense and damage time; Routine activity theory; Social contagion,Anomaly detection; Crime; Damage detection; Online systems; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Anomaly detection; Cybe offender and victim; Cyberspaces; Damage time; Network activities; Online users; Predicting offense and damage time; Routine activity theories; Social contagion; Unsupervised machine learning; article; extraction; human; offender; online social network; outlier detection; supervised machine learning; victim; Forecasting,,,,,"CyberAgent , Inc.; CyberAgent, Inc., (akblab-0005)","Funding text 1: Kenji Yokotani received funding through a grant ( akblab-0005 ) from CyberAgent , Inc., the company that operates the online chat platform Pigg Party. ; Funding text 2: The present study was funded by CyberAgent, Inc.

With children increasingly interacting with these tools, it is imperative for researchers to scrutinise the safety of LLMs, especially for applications that could lead to serious outcomes, such as online child safety queries. In this paper, the efficacy of LLMs for online grooming prevention is explored both for identifying and avoiding grooming through advice generation, and the impact of prompt design on model performance is investigated by varying the provided context and prompt specificity. In results reflecting over 6,000 LLM interactions, we find that no models were clearly appropriate for online grooming prevention, with an observed lack of consistency in behaviours, and potential for harmful answer generation, especially from open-source models. We outline where and how models fall short, providing suggestions for improvement, and identify prompt designs that heavily altered model performance in troubling ways, with findings that can be used to inform best practice usage guides.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",advice generation; large language models; online child safety; online grooming detection; prompt design; prompt engineering,Safety engineering; Advice generation; Child safety; General publics; Language model; Large language model; Modeling performance; Online child safety; Online grooming detection; Prompt design; Prompt engineering; Computational linguistics,,,,,"University of Bristol; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (EP/S022937/1)",The authors wish to acknowledge and thank the financial support of the UKRI (Grant ref EP/S022937/1) and the University of Bristol.,"Abdelghani R., Wang Y.-H., Yuan X., Wang T., Lucas P., Sauzeon H., Oudeyer P.-Y., GPT-3-driven pedagogical agents to train children's curious question-asking skills, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 1-36, (2023); Bengio Y., Ducharme R., Vincent P., A neural probabilistic language model, Advances in neural information processing systems, 13, (2000); Brade S., Wang B., Sousa M., Oore S., Grossman T., Promptify: Text-to-image generation through interactive prompt exploration with large language models, Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, pp. 1-14, (2023); Brown T., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J.D., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Askell A., Et al., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in neural information processing systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Chang E.Y., Prompting large language models with the socratic method, 2023 IEEE 13th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC).

Based on this data, we leveraged a human-centered machine learning approach to create sexual risk detection classifiers for youth social media conversations. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forest models outperformed in identifying sexual risks at the conversation-level (AUC=0.88), and CNN outperformed at the message-level (AUC=0.85). We also trained classifiers to detect the severity risk level (i.e., safe, low, medium-high) of a given message with CNN outperforming other models (AUC=0.88). A feature analysis yielded deeper insights into patterns found within sexually safe versus unsafe conversations. We found that contextual features (e.g., age, gender, and relationship type) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) contributed the most for accurately detecting sexual conversations that made youth feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Our analysis provides insights into the important factors and contextual features that enhance automated detection of sexual risks within youths' private conversations. As such, we make valuable contributions to the computational risk detection and adolescent online safety literature through our human-centered approach of collecting and ground truth coding private social media conversations of youth for the purpose of risk classification.  © 2023 ACM.",adolescents online safety; deep learning; machine learning; sexual risk detection; youth online risks,Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; E-learning; Feature extraction; Forestry; Learning systems; Random forests; Safety engineering; Social networking (online); Adolescent online safety; Contextual feature; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Risk detections; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Youth online risk; Risk assessment,,,,,,,"National Center for Missing Exploited Children, (2020); Agha Z., Chatlani N., Razi A., Wisniewski P., Towards Conducting Responsible Research with Teens and Parents Regarding Online Risks, Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Honolulu, HI, USA) (CHI EA '20), pp. 1-8, (2020); Ali S., Razi A., Kim S., Alsoubai A., Gracie J., De Choudhury M., Wisniewski P.J., Stringhini G., Understanding the Digital Lives of Youth: Analyzing Media Shared within Safe Versus Unsafe Private Conversations on Instagram, (2022); Alsoubai A., Caddle X.V., Doherty R., Taylor Koehler A., Sanchez E., De Choudhury M., Wisniewski P.J., MOSafely, Is That Sus?

The biggest drawback is the lack of tools focused on the automatic prevention of this risk. This paper proposes seven Behavioral Features (BFs) to be used for early grooming detection. A detailed study is conducted to understand the background that allows these features to contribute to tasks of early classification. Besides, we introduce the Behavioral Feature-Profile Specific Representation (BF-PSR) framework as an extension of the well-known Profile Specific Representation (PSR) framework to properly employ the proposed behavioral features. Experimental results reveal that our proposal outperforms all the concurrent methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance in the area of early grooming detection. Specifically, the new BF-PSR framework achieves a gain of more than 40% in effectiveness over five competitors when only 10% of the conversations’ content is available, thus it shows a substantial advantage to allow the early detection of grooming; besides, it maintains a similar gain in effectiveness as more data arrives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ behavioral features for the early detection of grooming. Furthermore, we have assembled two new datasets called PJZ and PJZC to mitigate the lack of data in the grooming detection area. Both sets are publicly available for download aimed at fostering further researches. Additional experiments reveal that our BF-PSR framework outperforms all of the state-of-the-art methods when processing these new datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioral features; Classification with partial information; Early text classification; Online grooming detection,Feature extraction; Social networking (online); Text processing; Additional experiments; Behavioral features; Classification with partial information; Early text classification; Feature profiles; Online grooming detection; Partial information; State-of-the-art methods; State-of-the-art performance; Young peoples; Classification (of information),,,,,"Brazilian Coordination for Improvement of Higher Level Personnel, (001); Brazilian National Council for Supporting Research, (130384/2020-8); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2016/17078-0, 2018/05714-5, 2020/07200-9); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This research was supported by FAPESP (São Paulo State Research Foundation), Brazil [grants 2020/07200-9 , 2018/05714-5 and 2016/17078-0 ], CAPES (Brazilian Coordination for Improvement of Higher Level Personnel), Brazil [grant 001 ] and CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Supporting Research) [grant 130384/2020-8 ].","Escalante H.J., Villatoro-Tello E., Garza S.E., Lpez-Monroy A.P., Montes-y Gmez M., Villaseor-Pineda L., Early detection of deception and aggressiveness using profile-based representations, Expert Syst.

Through a comparative analysis of various machine learning models, including traditional approaches and deep learning architectures, the study evaluates their effectiveness in accurately detecting and categorizing crime-related text data. The performance of the models is assessed using rigorous evaluation metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), to provide insights into their discriminative power and reliability. The findings reveal that machine learning frameworks, particularly the deep learning model, consistently outperform conventional machine learning approaches, highlighting the potential of advanced neural network architectures in crime analysis tasks. The implications of these findings for law enforcement agencies and researchers are discussed, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance crime prevention and intervention efforts. Furthermore, avenues for future research are identified, including the integration of multiple data sources and the exploration of interpretability and explainability of machine learning models in crime analysis problem. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the field of crime analysis problem and underscores the importance of leveraging innovative computational approaches to address complex societal challenges. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

It highlights the importance of detecting child predators making advantage of machine learning and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The proposed system includes three modules: the user, training module, and cyber system, and uses SVM for image and text classification. The system aims to protect children from sexual abuse by detecting and reporting damaging comments and posts made by predators on social media platforms. Existing systems use various classification algorithms, while the proposed system offers higher accuracy with the use of SVM. The system's function involves receiving input from users, going through posts and comments, classifying messages and pictures, and forwarding reports to cyber admins for further action.

One of the most attracting ones is streaming. Users may broadcast part of their daily lives to thousands of others world-wide and interact with them in real-time. Unfortunately, this feature is reportedly exploited for grooming. In this work, we provide the first in-depth analysis of this problem for social live streaming services. More precisely, using a dataset that we collected, we identify predatory behaviours and grooming on chats that bypassed the moderation mechanisms of the LiveMe, the service under investigation. Beyond the traditional text approaches, we also investigate the relevance of emojis in this context, as well as the user interactions through the gift mechanisms of LiveMe. Finally, our analysis indicates the possibility of grooming towards minors, showing the extent of the problem in such platforms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Emoji; LDA; Online grooming; Social networks; Text analysis,Computers; Daily lives; Emoji; In-depth analysis; Large-scale analysis; LDA; Live streaming; Online grooming; Real- time; Social network; Text analysis; Social networking (online),,,,,"Nvidia; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (830929, 832735); European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020), as part of the projects CyberSection 4Europe (https://www.cybersec4europe.eu) (Grant Agreement No. 830929) and LOCARD (https://locard.eu) (Grant Agreement No. 832735).

Over the last few years, the rate of online grooming has seen a massive increase along with an increase in the number of teenage users. The proposed system, Prevention of Emotional Entrapment of Children (PEEC), consists of an age detection module using Deep Neural Network (DNN) as well as a grooming detection module using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to monitor the conversations of only those users who come under the category of minor (below 18). The resultant system gave an accuracy of 84% for age detection and 91% for grooming detection. © 2021 IEEE.",child harassment; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA); Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC); Online grooming; paedophilia,Deep neural networks; Statistics; Support vector machines; Child harassment; Detection modules; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Linguistic inquiry and word count; Online grooming; Pedophilia; Pressung; Social media; Support vectors machine; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Bretschneider U., Wohner T., Peters R., Detecting Online Harassment in Social Networks; Williams R., Elliott I.A., Beech A.R., Identifying sexual grooming themes used by internet sex offenders, Deviant Behavior; Zuo Z., Li J., Anderson P., Yang L., Grooming detection using fuzzy-rough feature selection and text classification, Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); Jonsson L.S., Fredlund C., Priebe G., Wadsby M., Svedin C.G., Online sexual abuse of adolescents by a perpetrator met online: A cross-sectional study, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, (); Dombrowski S.C., LeMasney J.W., Ahia C.E., Dickson S.A., Protecting children from online sexual predators:technological, psychoeduca-tional, and legal considerations, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, (); Gupta A., Kumaraguru P., Sureka A., Characterizing Pedophile Conversations on the Internet Using Online Grooming; Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics; Van Loo De J., De Pauw G., Daelemans W., Text-based age and gender prediction for online safety monitoring, International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics (IJCSDF); Tam J., Martell C.H., Age detection in chat, Ieee International Conference on Semantic Computing; Pentel A., Effect of different feature types on age based classification of short texts, Th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA), Corfu; Ashcroft M., Kaati L., Meyer M., A step towards detecting online grooming-identifying adults pretending to be children, European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference, Manchester; Pandya A., Oussalah M., Monachesi P., Kostakos P., Loven L., On the use of urls and hashtags in age prediction of twitter users, Ieee International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI), Salt Lake City, Ut; Guimaraes R.G., Rosa R.L., De Gaetano D., Rodriguez D.Z., Bressan G., Age groups classification in social network using deep learning, Ieee Access; Adams P.H., Martell C.H., Topic detection and extraction in chat, Ieee International Conference on Semantic Computing; Vartapetiance A., Gillam L., Our little secret"": Pinpointing potential predators, Security Informatics; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET); Anderson P., Zuo Z., Yang L., Qu Y., An intelligent online grooming detection system using ai technologies, Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); Cardei C., Rebeda T., Detecting sexual predators in chats using behavioral features and imbalanced learning, Natural Language Engineering; Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, Th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), Porto, Portugal; Munoz F., Isaza G., Castillo L., Smartseccop: Smart cyber-grooming detection using natural language processing and convolutional neural networks, Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Th International Conference; Zambrano P., Torres J., Tello-Oquendo L., Jacome R., Benalcazar M.E., Andrade R., Fuertes W., Technical mapping of the grooming anatomy using machine learning paradigms: An information security approach, Ieee Access; Perverted-justice.com-the Largest and Best Anti-Predator Organization Online; Non-Grooming Conversations; Abusive and Sexual Conversations between Adults",,Mallenahalli N.; Bhattacharya A.; Senatore S.; Negi A.; Hirose A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Mahindra University,"2021 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence, ICETCI 2021",25 August 2021 through 27 August 2021,"Virtual, Hyderabad",173182.0,,978-166541559-0,,,English,"Proc.

This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Data driven technique; Large-scale problem; Machine learning methods; Online behavior; Social interactions; Social media datum; Social structure; Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms,,,,,,,"Wang J., Iannotti R.J., Nansel T.R., School bullying among US adolescents: Physical, verbal, relational and cyber, Journal of Adolescent Health, 45, pp. 368-375, (2009); Herring S.C., Cyber violence: Recognizing and resisting abuse in online environments, Asian Women, 14, pp. 187-212, (2002); Boyd D., It’S Complicated, (2014); Donath J.S., Identity and deception in the virtual community, Communities in Cyberspace, 1996, pp. 29-59, (1999); Shachaf P., Ha N., Beyond vandalism: Wikipedia trolls, Journal of Information Science, 36, pp. 357-370, (2010); Cheng J., Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil C., Leskovec J., Antisocial behavior in online discussion communities, CoRR, (2015); Corcoran L., Guckin C.M., Prentice G., Cyberbullying or cyber aggression?: A review of existing definitions of cyber-based peer-to-peer aggression, Societies, 5, 2, pp. 245-255, (2015); Whitney I., Smith P.K., A survey of the nature and extent of bullying in junior/middle and secondary schools, Educational Research, 35, 1, pp. 3-25, (1993); Farrington D.P., Understanding and preventing bullying, Crime and Justice, pp. 381-458, (1993); Patchin J.W., Hinduja S., Cyberbullying Prevention and Response: Expert Perspectives, (2012); Kowalski R.M., Limber S.P., Agatston P.W., Cyberbullying: Bullying in The Digital Age, (2012); Smith P.K., Mahdavi J., Carvalho M., Fisher S., Russell S., Tippett N., Cyberbullying: Its nature and impact in secondary school pupils, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 49, 4, pp. 376-385, (2008); Tokunaga R.S., Following you home from school: A critical review and synthesis of research on cyberbullying victimization, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, 3, pp. 277-287, (2010); Dordolo N., The role of power imbalance in cyberbullying, Inkblot: The Undergraduate J.

Not only is there challenges towards determining the authenticity of people, but also with analyzing the data that forms part of the communications. These data are of heterogeneous type and include photos, videos and sound. Furthermore, most social media platforms are operating in an uncontrolled environment. Any person can contribute content and take part. Even though age restrictions do exist there are no enforcement of these laws and honesty of the public is expected. This is dangerous for minors specifically as they are either unaware of the dangers or not mature enough to be responsible for their actions online. Online predators are aware of this fact and targeting this group specifically. This paper presents work-in-progress towards developing an intelligent Identity Deception Indicator (IDI). It is envisaged that this work could eventually assists authorities in doing large-scale observation on publicly available social media platforms, such as Twitter. Of particular interest are those personas whose behavior and online content does not fit with the age group they are conversing with. © 2015 IEEE.",Big Data; Cyber-security; Data Science; Identity deception; Social media,Artificial intelligence; Social networking (online); Cyber security; Data Science; Deception detection; Identity deception; On-line contents; Science experiments; Social media; Social media platforms; Big data,,,,,,,"Vrij A., Guidelines to Catch A Liar, (2004); Tsikerdekis M., Zeadally S., Detecting and Preventing Online Identity Deception in Social Networking Services, Internet Computing, IEEE, 19, pp. 41-49, (2015); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring high-level features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, pp. 108-120, (2014); Laney D., 3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity and Variety, (2001); Cai L., Zhu Y., The Challenges of Data Quality and Data Quality Assessment in the Big Data Era, Data Science Journal, 14, (2015); Assuncao M.D., Calheiros R.N., Bianchi S., Netto M.A., Buyya R., Big Data computing and clouds: Trends and future directions, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 79, pp. 3-15, (2015); Ali-Ud-Din Khan M., Uddin M.F., Gupta N., Seven V's of Big Data understanding Big Data to extract value, American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE Zone 1), 2014 Zone 1 Conference of the, pp. 1-5, (2014); Han R., Jia Z., Gao W., Tian X., Wang L., Benchmarking Big Data Systems: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions, (2015); Kierkegaard S., Cybering, online grooming and ageplay, Computer Law & Security Review, 24, pp. 41-55, (2008); Liccardi I., Bulger M., Abelson H., Weitzner D.J., Mackay W., Can apps play by the COPPA Rules?, Privacy, Security and Trust (PST), 2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on, pp. 1-9, (2014); Peersman C., Daelemans W., Van Vaerenbergh L., Predicting age and gender in online social networks, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Search and Mining User-generated Contents, pp. 37-44, (2011); O'Keeffe G.S., Clarke-Pearson K., The impact of social media on children, adolescents, and families, Pediatrics, 127, pp. 800-804, (2011); Hancock J.T., Thom-Santelli J., Ritchie T., Deception and design: The impact of communication technology on lying behavior, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 129-134, (2004); Alowibdi J.S., Buy U.A., Philip S.Y., Ghani S., Mokbel M., Deception detection in Twitter, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 5, pp. 1-16, (2015); Alowibdi J.S., Buy U., Yu P.S., Stenneth L., Detecting Deception in Online Social Networks, Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on, pp. 383-390, (2014); Guillory J., Hancock J.T., The effect of Linkedin on deception in resumes, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 15, pp. 135-140, (2012); Wang G.A., Chen H., Xu J.J., Atabakhsh H., Automatically detecting criminal identity deception: An adaptive detection algorithm, Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part A: Systems and Humans, IEEE Transactions on, 36, pp. 988-999, (2006); Van Der Walt E., Eloff J.H.P., Protecting minors on social media platforms - A Big Data Science experiment, The HPI Cloud Symposium ""operating the Cloud, (2015); Schwartz H.A., Eichstaedt J.C., Kern M.L., Dziurzynski L., Ramones S.M., Agrawal M., Et al., Personality, gender, and age in the language of social media: The open-vocabulary approach, PloS One, 8, (2013); SAP HANA predictive analytics library, SAP HANA Platform SPS 10, Vol. Document Revision 1.0, (2015)",,Tran Q.-N.; Deligiannidis L.; Arabnia H.R.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,American Council on Science and Education,"International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, CSCI 2015",7 December 2015 through 9 December 2015,Las Vegas,119673.0,,978-146739795-7,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

This work is important for a number of reasons: the increasing number of the Internet users across the globe, the increasing number of social media, increasing in the number and types of crime on the Internet, and the crime of sexual abuse in children impacts both physically and physiologically. Online grooming is the most reported suspected Internet activities in 2009-2010 according to Child Exploitation and Online Protection, which is a part of the UK's Home Office Serious Organized Crime agency. Around 160 online script conversations are analyzed to determine characteristics of a grooming conversation. Those scripts are obtained randomly from http://www.perverted-justice.com and www.literotika.com. The characteristics are divided into 20 types. The scripts are divided into two sets: 100 scripts for the training set and 59 scripts for the testing set. As the results, five most relevant grooming characteristics are identified from the paired t-test, and a logistic model is established on this basis. The model is evaluated using the testing data set, and the results show that the model has relatively good performance with 95% accuracy, 96% true positive, 4% false positive, 93% true negative, and 7% false negative. © 2015 The Authors.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors' classifiers. Besides, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method, which classifies a conversation using the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 textual conversations of which 105 are grooming, and 45 are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and k-NN can identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.",Grooming classifier; K-nearest neighbors; Online child grooming; Support vector machine,,,,,,,,"Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Whittle H., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A., Collings G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns, Aggression and violent behavior, 18, 1, pp. 62-70, (2013); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869, (2011); Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Leatherman A., Text mining and cybercrime, Text Mining: Applications and Theory, (2010); Mitchell K.J., Finkelhor D., Wolak J., Police posing as juveniles online to catch sex offenders: Is it working?, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17, 3, pp. 241-267, (2005); Briggs P., Simon W.T., Simonsen S., An exploratory study of internet-initiated sexual offenses and the chat room sex offender: Has the internet enabled a new typology of sex offender?, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, (2010); Webster S., Davidson J., Bifulco A., Gottschalk P., Pham C.V.T., Grove-Hills J., Turley C., Tompkins C., Ciulla S., Milazzo V., Schimmenti A., Craparo G., European online grooming project, (2012); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, Journal of advances in information technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Babaoglu I., Findik O., Ulker E., A comparison of feature selection models utilizing binary particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in determining coronary artery disease using support vector machine, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 4, pp. 3177-3183, (2010); Acharya U.R., Ng E., Tan J.H., Sree S.V., Thermography based breast cancer detection using texture features and support vector machine, Journal of medical systems, 36, 3, pp. 1503-1510, (2012); Horng S.J., Su M.Y., Chen Y.H., Kao T.W., Chen R.J., Lai J.L., Perkasa C.D., A novel intrusion detection system based on hierarchical clustering and support vector machines, Expert systems with Applications, 38, 1, pp. 306-313, (2011); O'Connel R.A., Typology of cybersex exploitation and online grooming process, (2014); Gupta V., Lehal G., A survey of text summarization extractive techniques, Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence, 2, 3, pp. 258-268, (2010); Christianni N., Shawe Taylor J., An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, (2000); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning, (2008); Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, Journal of advances in information technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Powers D.M., Evaluation: From precision, recall, and F-measure to roc, informedness, markedness & correlation, Journal of Machine Learning Technologies, 2, 1, pp. 37-63, (2011); Justice P.; Wollis M., A linguistic analysis of online predator grooming, (2011); Bergen E., Davidson J., Schulz A., Schuhmann P., Johansson A., The effects of using identity deception and suggesting secrecy on the outcomes of adult-adult and adult-child or-adolescent online sexual interactions, Victims and Offenders, 9, pp. 276-298, (2014)","F.E.

The use by minors of social networks applications, and games that are connected to the internet offer the possibility of communication, can make them exposed to various threats. One of the most troubling threats is sexual abuse. Thus the objective of this project is to create a model for classifying messages, as normal or dangerous, according to the risk they present to the minor. In addition to integrating the developed model with a project that analyzes the behavior of minors in a social network (Facebook), and calculates the risk of the minor be a victim of sexual abuse. Finally, we use the model in the classification of messages obtained from a server of the game Minecraft, quite popular among children. © 2018, © 2018 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",children and teenagers protection; clustering messages; messages exchange classification; minecraft; social media,,,,,,,,"Araujo Leite J.L., Mineracao de textos do twitter utilizando tecnicas de classificação, (2015); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predatorsProceedings of the 3rd workshop in computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, (2012); Carletta J., Assessing agreement on classification tasks: The Kappa statistic, Computational Linguistics, 22, 2, pp. 249-254, (1996); Cheng Y., Chen K., Sun H., Zhang Y., Tao F., Data and knowledge mining with big data towards smart production, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 9, pp. 1-13, (2018); de Souza Viana T.S., de Oliveira M., da Silva T.L.C., Junior M.S.R.F., Goncalves E.J.T., Textual analysis for the protection of children and teenagers in social media–classification of inappropriate messages for children and teenagersProceedings of the 19th international conference on enterprise information systems–Volume 2: ICEIS, (2017); Duan L., Binbasioglu M., An ensemble framework for community detection, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 5, pp. 1-5, (2017); Duan L., Xu L., Business intelligence for enterprise systems: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 3, pp. 679-687, (2012); Falcao Jr M.S.R., Goncalves E.J.T., da Silva T.L.C., de Oliveira M., Behavioral analysis for child protection in social network through data mining and multiagent systemsProceedings of the 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems–Volume 2: ICEIS, (2016); Fayyad U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro G., Smyth P., Advances in knowledge discovery and data miningChapter from data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview, (1996); Hall M., Frank E., Holmes G., Pfahringer B., Reutemann P., Witten I.H., The WEKA data mining software: An update, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11, 1, pp. 10-18, (2009); Macwan S., inz Grzegorz Filcek D., Web mining against pedophilia, International Education and Research Journal, 3, 5, (2017); McCallum A., Nigam K., AAAI-98 workshop on learning for text categorization, (1998); Metsis V., Androutsopoulos I., Paliouras G., Spam filtering with Naive Bayes–which Naive Bayes?, (2006); Moreno-Sandoval L.G., Beltran-Herrera P., Vargas-Cruz J.A., Sanchez-Barriga C., Pomares-Quimbaya A., Alvarado-Valencia J.A., Garcia-Diaz J.C., CSL: A combined Spanish lexicon–resource for polarity classification and sentiment analysisProceedings of the 19th international conference on enterprise information systems–Volume 1: ICEIS, (2017); Morris C., Hirst G., CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), (2012); Tan P.N., Introduction to data mining, (2006); Velmurugan T., Santhanam T., Computational complexity between k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms for normal and uniform distributions of data points, Journal of Computer Science, 6, pp. 363-368, (2010); Yuan R., Li Z., Guan X., Xu L., An SVM-based machine learning method for accurate internet traffic classification, Information Systems Frontiers, 12, 2, pp. 149-156, (2010)","M. de Oliveira; Universidade Federal do Ceará, Quixadá, Brazil; email: marcos.oliveira@ufc.br",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,,,,23270012,,,,English,J.

Most prior linguistic and psychological research into online sexual abuse analyses transcripts involving adult decoys posing as children. In contrast, our data comprise genuine online conversations between the offender and 20 victims. Using move analysis (Swales 1981, 1990), we explore the offender’s numerous presented personas. The offender’s use of rhetorical moves is investigated, as is the extent to which the frequency and structure of these moves contribute to and discriminate between the various online personas he adopts. We find from eight frequently adopted personas that two divergent identity positions emerge: the sexual pursuer/aggressor, performed by the majority of his online personas, and the friend/boyfriend, performed by a single persona. Analysis of the offender’s self-describing assertives suggests this distinctive persona shares most attributes with the offender’s ‘home identity’. This article importantly raises the question of whether move analysis might be useful in identifying the ‘offline persona’ in cases where offenders are known to operate multiple online personas in the pursuit of child victims. © Oxford University Press 2018.",,,,,,,,,"Acar K.V., Sexual extortion of children in cyberspace, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 10, pp. 110-126, (2016); Bhatia V.K., Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, (1993); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behaviour in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse and Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Boon A., Identifying moves in an IMCD session, Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University, 21, pp. 219-235, (2013); Boon A., Learner Support and Discovery in A Virtual Non-Judgmental Environment, (2015); Bucholtz M., Why be normal?

However, Social Networking Sites is providing opportunities for cyberbullying activities. Cyberbullying is harassing or insulting a person by sending messages of hurting or threatening nature using electronic communication. Cyberbullying poses significant threat to physical and mental health of the victims. Detection of cyberbullying and the provision of subsequent preventive measures are the main courses of action to combat cyberbullying. The proposed method is an effective method to detect cyberbullying activities on social media. The detection method can identify the presence of cyberbullying terms and classify cyberbullying activities in social network such as Flaming, Harassment, Racism and Terrorism, using Fuzzy logic and Genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the system is increased using Fuzzy rule set to retrieve relevant data for classification from the input. In the proposed method Genetic algorithm is also used, for optimizing the parameters and to obtain precise output. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A number of studies have already addressed this issue, however, the data used in previous research did not properly represent the real chats found in multiplayer online games. To address this issue, we obtained real chat data from MovieStarPlanet, a massively multiplayer online game for children. The research described in this paper aimed to detect predatory behaviors in the chats using machine learning methods. In order to achieve a high accuracy on this task, extensive preprocessing was necessary. We describe three different strategies for data selection and preprocessing, and extensively compare the performance of different learning algorithms on the different data sets and features. © 2015 IEEE.",Chat; data mining; game data; natural language processing (NLP); preprocessing; sexual predator; text classification,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Chat; game data; NAtural language processing; preprocessing; sexual predator; Text classification; Learning algorithms,,,,,,,"Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Leatherman A., Text Mining and Cybercrime, pp. 149-164, (2010); Sonia L., Leslie H., Anke G., Kjartan O., Risks and Safety on the Internet: The Perspective of European Children: Full Findings and Policy Implications from the EU Kids Online Survey of 9-16 Year Olds and Their Parents in 25 Countries, (2011); Morris C., Identifying Online Sexual Predators by SVM Classification with Lexical and Behavioral Features, (2013); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proc. 3rd Workshop Comput.

Existing technology and non-technology based intervention programs do not provide assistance at the onset of abuse. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a mobile phone application that can detect digital dating abuse. As a step toward this goal we are investigating the use of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to flag text messages as abusive or non-abusive in the context of dating abuse. Due to the lack of a publicly available dataset that could be used to create training and testing sets for the classifiers, we first had to create and validate a dataset of abusive text messages. This paper describes the dataset creation process and the results of an evaluation of different classification and feature extraction techniques used to detect abusive texts. © 2018 IEEE.",Classifiers; Dataset Creation And Validation; Digital Dating Abuse; Machine Learning,Artificial intelligence; Classifiers; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; mHealth; Natural language processing systems; Statistical tests; Creation process; Dataset Creation And Validation; Digital Dating Abuse; Feature extraction techniques; Intervention programs; Mobile phone applications; Natural languages; Training and testing; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"Stonard K.E., Bowen E., Walker K., Price S.A., They'll always find a way to get to you.

Especially among young people, social networks have become a part of everyday life and the cyberbullying problem has arisen as a result of hiding the credentials of people in cyberspace and reaching every level. In this study was carried out assays for the detection of cyberbullying. A total of 3469 reviews from Youtube were tagged as positive and negative, depending on whether have contained bullying. In the analyzes, the number of features of the data set was reduced to 10, 50, 100, 250 and 500 using the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR), ReliefF and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithms as feature selection algorithms, support vector machines (SVM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), radial basis function (RBF) and logistic regression (LR) have been preferred as classification algorithms.

Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain set of “manually” elaborated conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples of humans’ interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Conversational agent; Cyber-pedophilia; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora; Natural language processing,Linguistics; Speech processing; Conversational agents; Cyber-pedophilia; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora; NAtural language processing; Conversational systems; Dialogue systems; Law enforcement officers; Natural languages; Natural language processing systems,,,,,"Language Technologies Thematic Network, (260178, 271622); Thematic Networks program; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Acknowledgments.

In addition, the sheer volume of cases involving the online sexual solicitation of minors makes it difficult for law enforcement to determine whether an offender is contact-driven vs. fantasy-driven. However, research shows that there are language-based differences between minors and contact-driven offenders vs. fantasy driven-offenders. Thus, we developed the Chat Analysis Triage Tool (CATT), a forensically sound investigative tool that, based on natural language processing methods, analyzes and compares chats between minors and contact-driven vs. non-contract driven offenders. Using an SVM classifier, we were successful in differentiating the classes based on character trigrams. In a matter of seconds, the existing algorithms provide an identification of an offender's risk level based on the likelihood of contact offending as inferred from the model, which assists law enforcement in their ability to triage and prioritize cases involving the sexual solicitation of minors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chat, machine learning; Child sexual exploitation; Digital forensics; Internet crimes against children; Linguistic inquiry and word count; Sexual solicitations","Adult; Algorithms; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Fantasy; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Internet; Linguistics; Natural Language Processing; Police; Software; Support Vector Machine; article; child; classifier; emergency health service; fantasy; female; human; human experiment; Internet; law enforcement; male; natural language processing; sexual crime; sexual exploitation; sound; adult; algorithm; child sexual abuse; diagnosis; fantasy; forensic science; linguistics; natural language processing; police; software; support vector machine",,,,,"Purdue Polytechnic Institute; Purdue University, PU","This project was funded through an internet grant, 2016 Purdue Polytechnic Institute Seed Grant program, at Purdue University.

The profiling methodology focuses on problematic paraphilic interests, involving illegal or non-consensual activities associated with the sexual victimisation of children. This work extends an earlier typal analysis carried out by Hammond et al. (2009. An examination of problematic paraphilic use of peer to peer facilities. In Advances in the analysis of online paedophile activity (pp. 65–73). Paris: MAPAP Project) in which a distinct problematic paraphilic typology was uncovered in the search behaviours of P2P users. The methodology described focuses on the subsequent development of a latent class model that underpins the operation of the profiling application. The composite profiling process is described. Finally, we discuss the prospective applications of this profiling process and the implications of our methodological design. We identify a series of recommendations for future research and for the design of profiling and risk appraisal processes with application to online CSEM offending behaviour. © 2016 National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers.",Child Sexual Exploitation Material; internet investigation; latent class analysis; paraphilia; peer-to-peer; profiling; risk assessment,child; disease carrier; France; human; Internet; model; risk assessment; sexual deviation; sexual exploitation,,,,,,,"Abel G.G., Becker J.V., Cunningham-Rathner J., Mittelman M., Rouleau J.L., Multiple paraphilic diagnoses among sex offenders, Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online, 16, 2, pp. 153-168, (1988); Abel G.G., Osborn C., The paraphilias: The extent and nature of sexually deviant and criminal behavior, Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 15, pp. 675-687, (1992); Alison L., Goodwill A., Almond L., van den Heuvel C., Winter J., Pragmatic solutions to offender profiling and behavioural investigative advice, Legal and Criminological Psychology, 15, 1, pp. 115-132, (2010); Blanchard R., Lykins A.D., Wherrett D., Kuban M.E., Cantor J.M., Blak T., Klassen P.E., Pedophilia, hebephilia, and the DSM-V, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38, 3, pp. 335-350, (2009); Calder M.C., Child sexual abuse and the internet: Tackling the new frontier, (2004); Canter D.V., Heritage R., A multivariate model of sexual offence behaviour: Developments in offender profiling, Journal of Forensic Psychiatry, 1, pp. 185-212, (1989); Canter D.V., Hughes D., Kirby S., Paedophilia: Pathology, criminality, or both?

However, as social networking has become widespread, certain people are finding illegal and unethical ways to use these communities as means for opening the door of inappropriate online activities. Thus, they are providing an open way for cybercrimes such as cyberbullying. In this paper, we deal with the aforementioned issue as a time series modelling methodology, aiming at the recognition of bullying patterns within the questions posed by a predator to his victims. Given a set of real world transcripts (i.e. the whole set of predator's questions), in which each question is numerically labelled in terms of severity, we first model each set of predator's questions as a time series. The next step is the main contribution of this paper, in terms of changing the representation scheme from time series data into symbolic representation. More specifically, inspired by the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) method, commonly used in computational biology for identifying conserved regions of similarity among raw molecular data, we represent the set of signals according to a SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) symbolic representation, transforming each signal into a symbol string. The main rationale behind this adoption lies to the fact that the collected cyberbullying data can be converted to string sequences via SAX conversion, which in turn can be aligned, thus revealing conserved temporal patterns or slight variations in the attacking strategies of the predators. Experimental results, based on the clustering improvement of the aforementioned data using the extracted patterns instead of the time series data, justify our claims. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such detrimental online behaviors. We propose a weakly supervised machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying using minimal effort and cost, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. The weak supervision is in the form of expert-provided small seed of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). To evaluate PVC, we perform extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three social media datasets: Twitter, Ask.fm, and Instagram. We illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the model by analyzing the identified conversations and key phrases by PVC. In addition, we demonstrate the distributions of bully and victim scores to examine the relationship between the tendencies of users to bully or to be victimized. We also perform fairness evaluation to analyze the potential for automated detection to be biased against particular groups. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,Computer crime; Health risks; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Automated detection; Data driven technique; Fairness evaluation; Model estimates; Qualitative experiments; Social interactions; Social structure; Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms,,,,,,,"Ashktorab Z., Vitak J., Designing cyberbullying mitigation and prevention solutions through participatory design with teenagers, Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3895-3905, (2016); Bellmore A., Calvin A.J., Xu J.-M., Zhu X., The five W’s of bullying on Twitter: who, what, why, where, and when, Comput Hum Behav, 44, pp. 305-314, (2015); Bifet A., Frank E., Sentiment knowledge discovery in Twitter streaming data, International Conference on Discovery Science, pp. 1-15, (2010); Boyd D., It’s complicated, (2014); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Mean birds: Detecting aggression and bullying on twitter, In: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference, (2017); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Measuring #gamergate: A tale of hate, sexism, and bullying, Proceedings of the 26Th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 1285-1290, (2017); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., Cristofaro E.D., Stringhini G., Vakili A., Hate is not binary: Studying abusive behavior of #gamergate on twitter, In: Proceedings of the 28Th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media, (2017); Chatzakou D., Kourtellis N., Blackburn J., DeCristofaro E., Stringhini G., Vakali A., Detecting aggressors and bullies on Twitter.

Although it doesn't directly create some negative effects of traditional child prostitution like sexually transmitted diseases, it may provide future offenders and victims to the traditional crimes such as child prostitution and child sex tourism. Therefore, appropriate and effective prevention strategies for this heinous act should be introduced accordingly. In this respect, this article discuss the efficiency of current methods of detection and propose some futuristic methods such as metadata and content data analysis of VoIP communications by the private sector and the use of fully automated chatbots for undercover operations.

The detection of sexual predation is one of the most important and challenging tasks in our days. Using real-world data, we follow a time series modeling approach, in which predator’s posts (i. e. questions) are associated with numeric labels, according to the style of the attack (e. g. attempts for physical approach, grooming, retrieval of personal information, etc.). Upon modeling the domain as time series, in order to allow for forecasting the severity of a future question of a predator (i. e. the class label), a sliding window method was adopted. Two well-known methods that have been traditionally applied in time series problems, namely Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, were utilized for forecasting. Simultaneously, since text processing is almost certain to derive a large number of input features, an additional method for reducing dimensionality of the original dataset was applied, implemented with Singular Value Decomposition. We demonstrate that the use of SVM classifier is more appropriate for our data and we show that it is able to provide accurate results that surpass current state-of-the-art outcomes, by using both the original feature set as well as the reduced SVD dimensions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Computer crime; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Text processing; Time series; Personal information; Physical approaches; Sliding window methods; Social media platforms; State of the art; SVM classifiers; Time series forecasting; Time series modeling; Singular value decomposition,,,,,,,"Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop-Working Notes Papers, (2012); Kontostathis A., Reynolds K., Garron A., Edwards L., Detecting cyberbullying: Query terms and techniques, Proceedings of the 5Th Annual ACM Web Science Conference, pp. 195-204, (2013); Yin Z.X., Hong L., Davison B.D., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Detection of harassment on web 2. 0, CAW 2. 0 2009: Proceedings of the 1St Content Analysis in Web 2. 0, (2009); Dadvar M., De Jong F., Ordelman R., Trieschnigg D., Improved cyberbullying detection using gender information, Proceedings of the 12Th-Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop (DIR 2012), (2012); (2008); Kalman D., Asingularly valuable decomposition: The SVDof a matrix, College Math.

However, Social Networking Sites is providing opportunities for cyberbullying activities. Cyberbullying is harassing or insulting a person by sending messages of hurting or threatening nature using electronic communication. Cyberbullying poses significant threat to physical and mental health of the victims. Detection of cyberbullying and the provision of subsequent preventive measures are the main courses of action to combat cyberbullying. A cyberbully detection system to identify and classify cyberbullying activities such as Flaming, Harassment, Racism and Terrorism in Social network is proposed.

Yet, research exploring how the language used by such individuals might reflect their psychological world is scarce. Interestingly, researchers have largely assumed that adults who engage in OG behaviours create a deceptive relationship to reach sexual intent. However, no study to date has investigated the deceptive component of these interactions. Objective: To explore the psycholinguistic and deceptive properties of chats where OG is present, from the perspective of front-line specialists. Participants and Setting: Prison staff (n = 7) and police officers (n = 9) and sixty-five chat logs from adults convicted of an online sexual offence against a minor. Methods: A mixed-method approach was employed, whereby qualitative (focus groups) data collection informed subsequent quantitative (the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)) data analyse of adult-child online sexual chats, using the model of OG discourse as the theoretical rationale. Results: Specialist considered that the online abuse/exploitation of minors can occur without deception. Adults who engage in OG behaviour use language that denotes affiliation with a positive emotional tone (p = .003, ηp2 = .59). The communicative focus is the development of an interpersonal relationship, above engagement in sexual talk (p < .001, ηp2 = .96). Conclusions: Findings challenge the common perception that the relationship is centred on deception and identify the intention of some adults as the development of a perceived genuine interpersonal relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Child sexual offenders; Deception; Online grooming; Psycho-linguistics,"Adult; Animals; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Communication; Emotions; Humans; Internet; Interpersonal Relations; Language; Linguistics; Male; Pedophilia; Police; Prisons; United Kingdom; adult; article; child; comparative study; controlled study; conversation; deception; female; grooming; human; human experiment; human relation; language; major clinical study; male; perception; police; prison; psycholinguistics; quantitative analysis; sexual crime; theoretical study; animal; child sexual abuse; comparative study; correctional facility; emotion; Internet; interpersonal communication; linguistics; pedophilia; police; psychology; United Kingdom",,,,,S wansea University; Swansea University,"Funding text 1: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

At its core, Protectbot incorporates DialoGPT, a conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) model rooted in Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) technology, engineered to simulate human-like interactions within gaming chat rooms. The framework is distinguished by a robust text classification strategy, rigorously trained on the Publicly Available Natural 2012 (PAN12) dataset, aimed at identifying and mitigating potential sexual predatory behaviors through chat conversation analysis. By utilizing fastText for word embeddings to vectorize sentences, we have refined a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, achieving remarkable performance metrics, with recall, accuracy, and F-scores approaching 0.99. These metrics not only demonstrate the classifier’s effectiveness, but also signify a significant advancement beyond existing methodologies in this field. The efficacy of our framework is additionally validated on a custom dataset, composed of 71 predatory chat logs from the Perverted Justice website, further establishing the reliability and robustness of our classifier. Protectbot represents a crucial innovation in enhancing child safety within online gaming communities, providing a proactive, AI-enhanced solution to detect and address predatory threats promptly. Our findings highlight the immense potential of AI-driven interventions to create safer digital spaces for young users. © 2024 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; chatbot technology; child online safety; generative pre-trained transformer (GPT); machine learning; online gaming; predatory behavior detection,Classification (of information); E-learning; Online systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Behavior detection; Chatbot technology; Chatbots; Child online safety; Children online; Generative pre-trained transformer; Machine-learning; On-line gaming; Predatory behavior; Predatory behavior detection; Support vector machines,,,,,Academic Research Committee of Rochester Institute of Technology,"This research was funded by the Academic Research Committee of Rochester Institute of Technology, Dubai.","Faraz A., Mounsef J., Raza A., Willis S., Child Safety and Protection in the Online Gaming Ecosystem, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 115895-115913, (2022); Stalker P., Livingstone S., Kardefelt-Winthe D., Saeed M., Growing up in a Connected World, (2019); Helbing D., Brockmann D., Chadefaux T., Donnay K., Blanke U., Woolley-Meza O., Moussaid M., Johansson A., Krause J., Schutte S., Et al., Saving Human Lives: What Complexity Science and Information Systems can Contribute, J.

Social engineering is one of them that addresses the multidisciplinary challenges of cyber security. Nowadays, the attacks associated with social engineering are diverse, including the so-called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These have been the subject of numerous investigations; however, cybernetic attacks of similar nature as grooming have been excluded from these studies. In the last decade, various efforts have been made to understand the structure and approach of grooming from the field of computer science with the use of computational learning algorithms. Nevertheless, these studies are not aligned with information security. In this work, the study of grooming is formalized as a social engineering attack, contrasting its stages or phases with life cycles associated with APTs. To achieve this goal, we use a database of real cyber-pedophile chats; this information was refined and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to determine the stages of the attack. Once the number of stages was determined, we proceed to give them a linguistic context, and with the use of machine learning, a linear model was trained to obtain 97.6% of training accuracy. With these results, it was determined that the study of grooming could support research associated with social engineering and contribute to new fields of information security. © 2013 IEEE.",APT; Cyber-pedophile; grooming; pattern behavior; pedophile; social engineering,Life cycle; Linguistics; Machine learning; Security of data; Statistics; Cyber-pedophile; grooming; pattern behavior; pedophile; Social engineering; Learning algorithms,,,,,"Ecuadorian Corporation for the Development of Research; AcademyHealth, (GT-Cybersecurity)","This work was supported by the Ecuadorian Corporation for the Development of Research and the Academy (RED CEDIA) in the development of this study, within the Project under Grant GT-Cybersecurity.","Penna L., Clark A., Mohay G., Challenges of automating the detection of paedophile activity on the Internet, Proc. 1st Int.

Extremists' use of social media over the past decade or so has raised increasing concern among governments and media corporations alike. In Digital Grooming Nuria Lorenzo-Dus analyzes manipulation practices in digital spaces that are situated at, or beyond, the boundaries of law. Lorenzo-Dus identifies and examines in detail the online discourse of adults luring children for sexual abuse and exploitation (digital sexual grooming); extreme ideology groups aligning others to their views (digital ideological grooming); and drug dealers soliciting business in crypto markets (digital commercial grooming). With sophisticated style and stance analyses of large and varied datasets, the book reveals that digital sexual, ideological, and commercial grooming practices have much in common. Three stances—expertise, openness, and avidity—scaffold this manipulative work, which constructs groomers and their targets as sharing a homogenous identity. By shedding new light on grooming practices, this book provides a key resource for discourse analysis, forensic linguistics, communication, and media studies, as well as for practitioners aiming to counter online grooming through policy changes, detection software, and prevention-focused training to promote digital civility and safety. © Oxford University Press 2023.

This paper presents a privacy protection protocol in order to protect users from risks that may be encountered in their social networks activities. In particular, we focus on the sexual predators detection. For this purpose, we use text mining tools to classify doubtful conversations based on lexical and behavioral features extraction. Moreover, we are able to flag potential predators, by computing the predatorhood score according to the sum of features weights. Different experiments have been carried out based on comparative study between two machine learning algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and Naãŕve Bayes (NB). The results are very promising. © 2016 ACM.",Community detection; Machine learning; Predators; Privacy protection; Security; Social networks; Text mining,Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Data mining; Internet; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Personal computing; Support vector machines; Community detection; Predators; Privacy protection; Security; Text mining; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Aleman Y., Vilarino D., Pinto D., Searching Sexual Predators in Social Networks; Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Modelling fixated discourse in chats with cyberpedophiles, Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Deception Detection, pp. 86-90, (2012); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop in Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Escalante H.J., LabTL I., Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez A., Montes-Y Gomez M., Sexual predator detection in chats with chained classifiers, WASSA 2013, (2013); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), 30, (2012); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2011 IEEE Symposium On, pp. 864-869, (2011); Morris C., Identifying Online Sexual Predators by SVM Classification with Lexical and Behavioral Features, (2013); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, Null, pp. 235-241, (2007); RahmanMiah M.W., Yearwood J., Kulkarni S., Detection of child exploiting chats from a mixed chat dataset as text classification task, Proceedings of the Australian Language Technology Association Workshop, pp. 157-165, (2011); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes Y., Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), (2012); Wolak J., Finkelhor D., Mitchell K.J., Ybarra M.L., Online™ predators™ and their victims: Myths, realities, and implications for prevention and treatment, American Psychologist, 63, 2, (2008)",,Guezouli L.; Cruz H.T.; Hidoussi F.; Boubiche D.E.; Bounceur A.,Association for Computing Machinery,,"International Conference on Internet of Things and Cloud Computing, ICC 2016",22 March 2016 through 23 March 2016,Cambridge,121387.0,,978-145034063-2,,,English,ACM Int.

Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13-17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of ""safe""versus ""risky"". Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.  © 2022 ACM.",adolescents disclosures; artificial intelligence; sexting; sexual risk detection; sexual risks; social media,Adolescent disclosure; Classifieds; Internet access; Mixed method; Peer support; Risk detections; Sexting; Sexual risk; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Social networking (online),,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIP-1827700, IIS-1844881); William T.

Information systems research focused on the behavioural patterns of online solicitors of youth is scant and lacks a strong theoretical foundation. We address this gap through an evolved grounded theory analysis of 90 Perverted Justice transcripts to extract the behavioural patterns that emerge when online solicitors use instant messaging to enact behaviours of grooming, predation, offending, and control. The aims of the research are: (1) delineate between grooming behaviour, predatory behaviour, and offending behaviour; (2) differentiate between passive and controlling solicitor language; (3) disentangle these behaviours from what the technology permits; (4) extend the current understanding of cybersexual abuse to show grooming as only one aspect of a phenomenon that also includes predation and offence; and (5) identify how these results are important for academics and software developers. © Operational Research Society 2020.",child sexual abuse; grounded theory; Mike Gallivan; online sexual predation; Pär Ågerfalk; Social media; social media theory,Information systems; Grounded theory; Instant messaging; Software developer; Theoretical foundations; Unintended consequences; Online systems,,,,,,,"Akdeniz Y., (2016); Aljazzaf Z.M., Perry M., Capretz M.A., Online trust: Definition and principles, 2010 Fifth International Multi-conference on Computing in the Global Information Technology, Valencia, pp. 163-168, (2010); al-Khateeb H.M., Epiphaniou G., How technology can mitigate and counteract cyber-stalking and online grooming, Computer Fraud & Security, 2016, 1, pp. 14-18, (2016); Berson I.R., Grooming cybervictims: The psychosocial effects of online exploitation for youth, Scientific American, 2, 1, pp. 9-19, (2003); Birks D.F., Fernandez W., Levina N., Nasirin S., Grounded theory method in information systems research: Its nature, diversity and opportunities, European Journal of Information Systems, 22, 1, pp. 1-8, (2013); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring high-level features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); The Economist, (2016); Briggs P., Simon W.T., Simonsen S., pp. 72-91, (2011); Brown A., Relationships, community, and identity in the new virtual society, The Futurist, 45, 2, (2011); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Cheong Y.G., Jensen A.K., Gudnadottir E.R., Bae B.C., Togelius J., Detecting predatory behavior in game chats, IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, 7, 3, pp. 220-232, (2015); Chiesa A., Goldson E., Child sexual abuse, Pediatrics in Review, 38, 3, pp. 105-118, (2017); Chiluwa I., Social media networks and the discourse of resistance: A sociolinguistic CDA of Biafra online discourses, Discourse & Society, 23, 3, pp. 217-244, (2012); Choo K.R., Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences (Vol. 103).

While strides have been made regarding the computational facets of algorithms for “real-time” risk detection, such research has not yet evaluated these advancements through a human-centered lens. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 53 peer-reviewed articles on real-time risk detection on social media. Real-time detection was mainly operationalized as “early” detection after-the-fact based on pre-defined chunks of data and evaluated based on standard performance metrics, such as timeliness. We identified several human-centered opportunities for advancing current algorithms, such as integrating human insight in feature selection, algorithms' improvement considering human behavior, and utilizing human evaluations. This work serves as a critical call-to-action for the HCI and ML communities to work together to protect social media users before, during, and after exposure to risks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Human-Centered Machine Learning; Literature Review; Online Risk; Real-Time Risk Detection; Social Media,Behavioral research; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Human-centered machine learning; Literature reviews; Machine-learning; Online risk; Real- time; Real-time risk detection; Research agenda; Risk detections; Social media; Social media platforms; E-learning,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (-2329976, -2333207, -1942610); National Science Foundation, NSF; William T.

Several existing approaches analyze a limited amount of information stemming from the interactions of the child with the corresponding online party. Some restrict access to websites based on a blacklist of known forbidden URLs, others attempt to parse and analyze the exchanged multimedia content between the two parties. However, new URLs can be used to circumvent a blacklist, and images, video, and text can individually appear to be safe, but need to be judged jointly. We propose a highly modular framework of analyzing content in its final form at the user interface, or Human Computer Interaction (HCI) layer, as it appears before the child: on the screen and through the speakers. Our approach is to produce Children's Agents for Secure and Privacy Enhanced Reaction (CASPER), which analyzes screen captures and audio signals in real time in order to make a decision based on all of the information at its disposal, with limited hardware capabilities. We employ a collection of deep learning techniques for image, audio and text processing in order to categorize visual content as pornographic or neutral, and textual content as cyberbullying or neutral. We additionally contribute a custom dataset that offers a wide spectrum of objectionable content for evaluation and training purposes. CASPER demonstrates an average accuracy of 88% and an F1 score of 0.85 when classifying text, and an accuracy of 95% when classifying pornography.  © 2013 IEEE.",Cyber-bullying; cyber-grooming; online safety; pornography filter; real time agent,Computer hardware; Deep learning; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer systems; Media streaming; Online systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; User interfaces; Amount of information; Cybe-grooming; Cyber bullying; Features extraction; Hardware; Online safety; Pornography filter; Real - Time system; Real time agents; Streaming medium; Real time systems,,,,,"European Commission, EC, (825618); European Commission, EC",This work was supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through Next Generation Internet (NGI) Trust under Grant 825618.,"AlDahoul N., Karim H., Abdullah M., Fauzi M., Wazir A., Mansor S., See J., Transfer detection of YOLO to focus CNN's attention on nude regions for adult content detection, Symmetry, 13, 1, (2020); Bochkovskiy A., (2019); Avila S., Thome N., Cord M., Valle E., De Araujo A.A., Pooling in image representation: The visual codeword point of view, Comput.

It is therefore essential to have effective IT tools that automate the detection and blocking of this type of material, as manual filtering of huge volumes of data is practically impossible. The goal of this study is to carry out a comprehensive review of different learning strategies for the detection of sensitive content available in the literature, from the most conventional techniques to the most cutting-edge deep learning algorithms, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each, as well as the datasets used. The performance and scalability of the different strategies proposed in this work depend on the heterogeneity of the dataset, the feature extraction techniques (hashes, visual, audio, etc.) and the learning algorithms. Finally, new lines of research in sensitive-content detection are presented. © 2023 by the authors.",deep learning; digital forensics; image recognition; sensitive content; sexually explicit content detection; video classification,,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101021801); European Commission, EC","This work was supported by the HEROES project (http://heroes-fct.eu, accessed on 4 February 2023).

Consequently, children are exposed to multifaceted threats, such as cyberbullying, grooming, and sexting. Although the online gaming industry is taking concerted measures to create a safe environment for children to play and interact with, such efforts remain inadequate and fragmented. There is a vital need to develop laws and policies to regulate and build minimum standards for the industry to safeguard and protect children online on the one hand, while promoting innovations in the gaming industry to preempt such threats. Many tools have been adapted to control threats against children in the form of content filtering and parental controls, thereby restricting contact with children to protect them from child predators. Different approaches utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to detect child predatory behavior have been designed to provide potential detection and protection in this context. In this paper, we survey online threats to children in the gaming environment and present the limitations of existing solutions that address these threats. We also aimed to present the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting children against predatory behavior by presenting a systematic review of the available techniques in the literature. Therefore, this analysis provides not only recommendations to stakeholders to develop policies and practices that safeguard children when gaming, but also to the gaming industry to continue providing appropriate measures for a safe and entertaining gaming environment. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; chat logs; child protection; cyberbullying; machine learning; online gaming; predatory threats,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computer crime; Consumer protection; E-learning; Learning systems; Online systems; Behavioral science; Censorship; Chat logs; Child protections; Cyber bullying; Game; Machine-learning; On-line gaming; Predatory threat; Face recognition,,,,,"Rochester Institute of Technology's Academic Research Committee; Australian Research Council, ARC",This work was supported in part by the Grant from the Rochester Institute of Technology's Academic Research Committee (ARC).,"Kemp S., Digital 2021, (2021); Stalker P., Livingstone S., Kardefelt-Winther D., Saeed M., Growing up in a connected world, (2019); Weru T., Sevilla J., Olukuru J., Mutegi L., Mberi T., Cybersmart children, cyber-safe teenagers: Enhancing internet safety for children, Proc.

Online grooming detection requires a deep knowledge of predatory behaviour where an online conversation's positive or negative connotations rely on the context where it can change rapidly in an online chat. Therefore, it is essential to use robust feature vectors for predatory conversation detection. This research paper proposes a contrastive learning framework for feature extraction in a sentence-based manner where it can assign a feature vector to the conversation with misspellings using subword information. Also, it is vital to have a high detection rate of true positives to avoid potential non-wanted consequences. We propose a configuration of RoBERTa encoders and supervised SimCSE for training the SVM model, leading to a high rate of detecting relevant samples (predatory samples). Our proposed approach gains an F0.5-score of 0.96, an F1-score of 0.96, and an accuracy of 0.99 for predatory conversation detection that benchmarks the state-of-the-art. In order to improve the performance, we also perform experiments with various fusion approaches, where the sum fusion of all configurations obtains an accuracy of 0.99, an F_1-score of 0.97, and an F0.5-score of 0.98.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",bert;

Detecting these risks with as much anticipation as possible is crucial for prevention. However, much research so far has focused on forensic tools that can be applied only when an attack has been performed. This paper proposes a novel and effective methodology for the early detection of threats in written social media. The goal is to recognize a potential attack before it is consummated, and using a minimum amount of information. The proposed approach considers the use of profile-based representations (PBRs) for this goal. PBRs have multiple benefits, including non-sparsity, low dimensionality, and a proved discriminative power. Moreover, representations for partial documents can be derived naturally with PBRs, which makes them suitable for the addressed problem. Results include empirical evidence on the usefulness of PBRs in the early recognition setting for two tasks in which anticipation is critical: sexual predator detection and aggressive text identification. These results reveal, on the one hand, that PBRs achieve state of the art performance when using full-length documents (i.e., the classical task), and, on the other hand, that the proposed methodology outperforms previous work on early recognition of sexual predators by a considerable margin, while obtaining state of the art performance in aggressive text identification. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported on early recognition for the approached problems. We foresee this work will pave the way for the development of novel methodologies for the problem and will motivate further research from the intelligent systems and text mining communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Aggressive text identification; Deception detection; Profile-based representations; Sexual predator detection,Data mining; Intelligent systems; Amount of information; Deception detection; Detection of deceptions; Discriminative power; Low dimensionality; Profile-based representations; State-of-the-art performance; Text identification; Character recognition,,,,,"Red Temática CONACYT en Tecnologías del Lenguaje, (260178, 271622); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (CB-2014-241306, CB-2015-1-258588, PDCPN2014-01-247870); Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, UANL","This work was supported by CONACYT under project grants CB-2014-241306, PDCPN2014-01-247870 and CB-2015-1-258588.

Many early research works have applied the footprints left by online predators to investigate online grooming. While digital forensics tools provide security to online users, it also encounters some critical challenges, such as privacy issues and the lack of data for research in this field. Our literature review investigates all research papers on grooming detection in online conversations by looking at the psychological definitions and aspects of grooming. We study the psychological theories behind the grooming characteristics used by machine learning models that have led to predatory stage detection. Our survey broadly considers the authorship profiling research works used for grooming detection in online conversations, along with predatory conversation detection and predatory identification approaches. Various approaches for online grooming detection have been evaluated based on the metrics used in the grooming detection problem. We have also categorized the available datasets and used feature vectors to give readers a deep knowledge of the problem considering their constraints and open research gaps. Finally, this survey details the constraints that challenge grooming detection, unaddressed problems, and possible future solutions to improve the state-of-the-art and make the algorithms more reliable. © 2022 The Author(s)",Chat analysis;

From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.  © 2021 ACM.",artificial intelligence; human-centered machine learning; literature review; online risks; sexual risk detection; social media,Computational methods; Crime; E-learning; Machine learning; Computational approach; Computational risks; Human-centered machine learning; Literature reviews; Online risk; Risk detections; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Systematic literature review; Victimisation; Social networking (online),,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (-1827700, -1844881); William T.

With the rise of cybercrimes targeting children, chat-logs can be used to discover and flag harmful behaviour for the attention of law enforcement units. This can make an important contribution to the safety of minors on SMPs from being exploited by online predators. The problem is that digital forensic investigation is mostly manual. Thus, a daunting task for forensic investigators because of the sheer volume and variety of data. The solution that is proposed in this paper employs a Digital Forensic Process Model that is supported by Machine Learning (ML) methods to facilitate the automatic discovery of harmful conversations in chat-logs. ML has already been successfully applied in the domain of text analysis for the discovery of online sexual predatory chats. However, there is an absence of approaches that show how ML can contribute to a digital forensic investigation. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to indicate how the tasks in a digital forensic investigation process can be organised so to obtain useable ML results when investigating online predators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber safety; Cybersecurity; Digital forensic investigation; Machine learning; Online sexual predatory conversation,Computer crime; E-learning; Electronic crime countermeasures; Machine learning; Automatic discovery; Chat logs; Cyber-crimes; Forensic investigation; Forensic process models; Social media platforms; Text analysis; Digital forensics,,,,,,,"Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2009); Amato F., Castiglione A., De Santo A., Moscato V., Picariello A., Persia F., Sperli G., Recognizing human behaviours in online social networks, Comput.

In this regard, online sex crimes are among the principal ones to prevent, especially those where a child is abused. The paper at hand proposes C3-Sex, a smart chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with suspects in order to profile their interest regarding online child sexual abuse. This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation. The ACE is designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies that constitute the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and calculate a set of 25 features that describes the suspect’s behavior. After 50 days of experiments, the chatbot generated a dataset with 7199 profiling vectors with the features associated to each suspect. Afterward, we applied an unsupervised method to describe the results that differentiate three groups, which we categorize as indifferent, interested, and pervert. Exhaustive analysis is conducted to validate the applicability and advantages of our solution. © 2020 by the authors.

Earlier studies have majorly employed machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting such conversations. Since deep learning frameworks have shown significant improvements in various text classification tasks, therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based classifier for detecting predatory conversations. Furthermore, instead of designing the system from the beginning, transfer learning has been proposed where the potential of the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is utilized to solve the predator detection problem. BERT is mostly used to encode the textual information of a document into its context-aware mathematical representation. The inclusion of this pre-trained model solves two major problems, i.e. feature extraction and Out of Vocabulary (OOV) terms. The proposed system comprises two components: a pre-trained BERT model and a feed-forward neural network. To design the classification system with a pre-trained BERT model, two approaches (feature-based and fine-tuning) have been used. Based on these approaches two solutions are proposed, namely, BERT_frozen and BERT_tuned where the latter approach is seen performing better than the existing classifiers in terms of F1 and F0.5 -scores. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",BERT; Child grooming; Deep learning; Language modelling; Online sexual predators,Classification (of information); Deep learning; E-learning; Feedforward neural networks; Modeling languages; Text processing; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Child grooming; Deep learning; Language model; Learning approach; Netizen; Online sexual predator; Social media; Transfer learning; Transformer modeling; Support vector machines,,,,,"European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, ERCIM",The work was supported by the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) Alain Bensoussan Fellowship Program.,"Rise in Online Child Sexual Abuse Cases Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic, (2021); Online Grooming of Children for Sexual Purposes: Model Legislation & Global Review.

Social biometric focuses on extracting the pattern a user exhibits while interacting and communicating through social networks. The paper addresses the online sexual predator problem by mining the vocabulary and emotional behavior, which could assist in identifying if the user is a benign or predator. The feature-set consists of vocabulary terms that appear differently in predator and victim content. In order to strengthen the detection model, the paper also focuses on distinguishing the two classes of users based on emotions reflected in their conversation. The experiments are performed on the PAN 2012 corpus. Two datasets are created with respect to vocabulary-based and emotion-based features. The results obtained on the test set have proved that by integrating the vocabulary and emotion-based attributes, the performance of the system is significantly enhanced. While comparing, the proposed approach has outperformed top existing methods by obtaining F1, F2, and F0.5values of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.96 respectively. Furthermore, we also recorded the best accuracy compared to state-of-the-art studies for our proposed SBB-based approach with 99.86%, 99.51%, and 99.88% for Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

A number of approaches have been proposed to analyze the content of the messages to identify predatory conversations. However, due to the non-availability of large-scale predatory data, the state-of-the-art works employ a standard dataset that has less than 10% predatory conversations. Dealing with such heavy class imbalance is a challenge to devise reliable predatory detection approaches. We present a new approach for dealing with class imbalance using a hybrid sampling and class re-distribution to obtain an augmented dataset. To further improve the diversity of classifiers and features in the ensembles, we also propose to perturb the data along with augmentation in an iterative manner. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate an improvement of 3% over the best state-of-the-art approach and results in an F1-score of 0.99 and an Fβ of 0.94 from the proposed approach.  © 2021 IEEE.",Imbalanced dataset; Online Conversation; Predatory Detection; Sampling,Art work; Class imbalance; Detection approach; Imbalanced dataset; Large-scales; New approaches; Online platforms; Predatory detection; Re-distribution; State of the art; Large dataset,,,,,,,"Bentley H., O'Hagan O., Raff A., Bhatti I., How safe are our children, The Most Comprehensive Overview of Child Protection in the UK, (2016); Craven S., Brown S., Gilchrist E., Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature and theoretical considerations, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 12, 3, pp. 287-299, (2006); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF (Online Working Notes/labs/workshop), 30, (2012); Latapy M., Magnien C., Fournier R., Quantifying paedophile queries in a large p2p system, 2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM.

Prior work has sought to automatically identify grooming chats, but only after an incidence has already happened in the context of legal prosecution. In this work, we instead investigate this problem from the point of view of prevention. We define and study the task of early sexual predator detection (eSPD) in chats, where the goal is to analyze a running chat from its beginning and predict grooming attempts as early and as accurately as possible. We survey existing datasets and their limitations regarding eSPD, and create a new dataset called PANC for more realistic evaluations. We present strong baselines built on BERT that also reach state-of-the-art results for conventional SPD. Finally, we consider coping with limited computational resources, as real-life applications require eSPD on mobile devices. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Computational resources;

Online grooming detection requires a deep knowledge of predatory behaviour where an online conversation's positive or negative connotations rely on the context where it can change rapidly in an online chat. Therefore, it is essential to use robust feature vectors for predatory conversation detection. This research paper proposes a contrastive learning framework for feature extraction in a sentence-based manner where it can assign a feature vector to the conversation with misspellings using subword information. Also, it is vital to have a high detection rate of true positives to avoid potential non-wanted consequences. We propose a configuration of RoBERTa encoders and supervised SimCSE for training the SVM model, leading to a high rate of detecting relevant samples (predatory samples). Our proposed approach gains an F0.5-score of 0.96, an F1-score of 0.96, and an accuracy of 0.99 for predatory conversation detection that benchmarks the state-of-the-art. In order to improve the performance, we also perform experiments with various fusion approaches, where the sum fusion of all configurations obtains an accuracy of 0.99, an F_1-score of 0.97, and an F0.5-score of 0.98.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",bert;

Yet the pervasiveness of these warnings is limited by their reliance on content creators and hosts. Rather than placing the sole responsibility of content moderation on content creators and hosts, our system shows a strong proof-of-concept for automatically generating content warnings on the user's side by utilizing keyword identification, sentiment analysis, and online intervention user interface principles. We designed our system as a Chrome extension and evaluated it by testing its accuracy on a dataset of websites with and without sensitive content, and performing a user-interaction lab study. With promising future areas of research such as the ability to personalize thresholds and customize content warnings for specific user needs, this research is a step towards a psychologically safer internet for everyone. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Content warning; Online intervention; Online safety; Topic identification; Trigger warning; Website classifier,Human engineering; Sentiment analysis; Statistical tests; Websites; Chrome extensions; Content creators; Proof of concept; User interaction; User need; User interfaces,,,,,"JST CREST, (JPMJCR17A3)","This work was supported by JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR17A3, Japan.","Abuleil S., Using nlp techniques for tagging events in Arabic text, 19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI 2007), 2, pp. 440-443, (2007); Bellet Jones P.J., Benjamin W., McNally R.J., Trigger warning: Empirical evidence ahead, Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 61, pp. 134-141, (2018); Panero Benway J., Banner blindness: The irony of attention grabbing on the world wide web, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 42, 5, pp. 463-467, (1998); Bird S., Klein E., Loper E., Baldridge J., Multidisciplinary instruction with the natural language toolkit, Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Issues in Teaching Computational Linguistics, pp. 62-70, (2008); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop in Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Boysen G.A., Evidence-based answers to questions about trigger warnings for clinically-based distress: A review for teachers, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology, 30, 2, pp. 163-177, (2017); Ghosh Chowdhury A., Sawhney R., Mathur P., Mahata D., Ratn Shah R., Speak up, fight back! detection of social media disclosures of sexual harassment, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop, pp. 136-146, (2019); An Introduction to Content Warnings and Trigger Warnings.

All of the reports strongly suggested that it becomes very urgent to tackle the online child grooming problem in order to protect children from sexual exploitation. Automatic sexual predator identification can be a promising solution to this issue since the number of online conversations is too large to be monitored manually. In this work, a two-stage is proposed with a combination of several features. The first stage is for detecting the predatory conversations while the second step aims to distinguish the predator from the victim in the predatory conversations. The features ensemble used will be combining lexical and behavioral features. The lexical features used include BoW, POS-based, topical, and emotion-based. Meanwhile, the behavioral features used for this work include the number of messages, the average number of words, the number of exclamation marks, the number of questions, sentence complexity and readability, and the number of intentions. SVM was used as a classifier due to its good ability for many text classification tasks. The experiment result shows that BoW with tf - idf term weighting provided the best performance for both PCI and VPD tasks. BoW with tf- idf term weighting obtained an F0.5 score of 0.9893 on PCI and 0.9798 on VPD. The features ensemble can exceed most of the individual features that form it but still cannot beat BoW. © 2023 IEEE.",Bag of Words; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Sexual Predator; SVM,Classification (of information); Text processing; Average numbers; Bag of words; Behavioral features; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Lexical features; Sexual predator; SVM; Term weighting; Support vector machines,,,,,,,"Wachs S., Wolf K.D., Pan C.-C., Cybergrooming: Risk factors, coping strategies and associations with cyberbullying, Psicothema, 24, 4, pp. 628-633, (2012); Choo K.-K.R., Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences, 103, (2009); Kierkegaard S., Cybering, online grooming and ageplay, Computer Law & Security Review, 24, 1, pp. 41-55, (2008); Clement J., Internet usage of teenagers in the united states - statistics facts, (2019); Britain G., Children and parents: Media use and attitudes report, (2013); Madigan S., Villani V., Azzopardi C., Laut D., Smith T., Temple J.R., Browne D., Dimitropoulos G., The prevalence of unwanted online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth: A meta-analysis, Journal of Adolescent Health, 63, 2, pp. 133-141, (2018); Vilarino D., Castillo E., Pinto D., Olmos I., Leon S., Information retrieval and classification based approaches for the sexual predator identification; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, 2019 International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET).

In this paper, we investigate different feature extraction approaches for predatory detection. While the previous results indicate good accuracy on predatory conversation detection, there is a missing investigation on the robustness of feature space. Further, we also show the impact of preprocessing on data to improve the performance of predator identification and predatory message classification. Various types of the bag of words features, including binary, term frequency, and TF-IDF representation are investigated on the publicly available PAN 2012 competition dataset for predator identification. Further, to cover the relationship between the words in the text analysis, the GloVe feature set is also investigated for word embedding features.

A number of approaches have been proposed to analyze the content of the messages to identify predatory conversations. However, due to the non-availability of large-scale predatory data, the state-of-the-art works employ a standard dataset that has less than 10% predatory conversations. Dealing with such heavy class imbalance is a challenge to devise reliable predatory detection approaches. We present a new approach for dealing with class imbalance using a hybrid sampling and class re-distribution to obtain an augmented dataset. To further improve the diversity of classifiers and features in the ensembles, we also propose to perturb the data along with augmentation in an iterative manner. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate an improvement of 3% over the best state-of-the-art approach and results in an F1-score of 0.99 and an Fβ of 0.94 from the proposed approach. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

For their education, children require access to the internet, as well as a standard institutional ICT infrastructure, including e-mail and other forms of online communication technology. Given the sheer volume of data being generated and shared on a daily basis within schools, most teachers and DSLs can no longer monitor the safety and wellbeing of their students without the use of specialist safeguarding software. In this paper, we experiment with the use of stateof-the-art neural network models on the modelling of a dataset of almost 9,000 anonymised child-generated chat messages on the Microsoft Teams platform. The dataset was manually annotated into two binary classes: true positives (real safeguarding concerns) and false positives (false alarms) that a monitoring program would be interested in. These classes were then further annotated into eight fine-grained classes of safeguarding concerns (or false alarms). For the binary classification, we achieved a macro F1 score of 87.32, while for the fine-grained classification, our models achieved a macro F1 score of 73.56. This first experiment into the use of Deep Learning for detecting safeguarding concerns represents an important step towards achieving high-accuracy and reliable monitoring information for busy teachers and safeguarding leads. © 2023 Incoma Ltd.

In this paper, we describe the novel application of a deep learning method to the automatic identification of predatory chat conversations in large volumes of chat logs. We present a classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address this problem domain. The proposed CNN architecture outperforms other classification techniques that are common in this domain including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and regular Neural Network (NN) in terms of classification performance, which is measured by F1-score. In addition, our experiments show that using existing pre-trained word vectors are not suitable for this specific domain. Furthermore, since the learning algorithm runs in a massively parallel environment (i.e., general-purpose GPU), the approach can benefit a large number of computation units (neurons) compared to when CPU is used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CNNs are adapted and applied to this application domain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Language model; Online predator identification; Predatory conversation; Support vector machine; Word embedding,Automation; Convolution; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Program processors; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Language model; Predatory conversation; Word embedding; Support vector machines,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (N00009)","This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ( N00009 ).

A sexual predator is defined as a person who tries to obtain sexual favors in a predatory manner, usually with underage people. The proposed approach uses several text categorization methods and empirical behavioral features developed especially for the task at hand. After investigating various approaches for solving the sexual predator identification problem, we have found that a two-stage classifier achieves the best results. In the first stage, we employ a Support Vector Machine classifier to distinguish conversations having suspicious content from safe online discussions. This is useful as most chat conversations in real life do not contain a sexual predator, therefore it can be viewed as a filtering phase that enables the actual detection of predators to be done only for suspicious chats that contain a sexual predator with a very high degree. In the second stage, we detect which of the users in a suspicious discussion is an actual predator using a Random Forest classifier. The system was tested on the corpus provided by the PAN 2012 workshop organizers and the results are encouraging because, as far as we know, our solution outperforms all previous approaches developed for solving this task. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,Decision trees;

Assistance in prioritizing cases of sexual exploitation of potentially risky conversations is crucial. While attempts to automatically triage conversations for the risk of sexual exploitation of minors have been attempted in the past, most computational models use features which are not representative of the grooming process that is used by investigators. Accurately annotating an offender corpus for use with machine learning algorithms is difficult because the stages of the grooming process feed into one another and are non-linear. In this paper we propose a method for labeling risk, tied to stages and themes of the grooming process, using fuzzy sets. We develop a neural network model that uses these fuzzy membership functions of each line in a chat as input and predict the risk of interaction. © 2019 IEEE.",,Fuzzy neural networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Membership functions; Computational model; Fuzzy membership function; Neural network model; Non linear; Risk perception,,,,,Purdue Research Foundation,ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was partially supported by Purdue Research Foundation.,"Online Enticement of Children: An In-Depth Analysis of CyberTipLine Reports, (2017); Whittle H.C., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A.R., Victimsfffdfffdfffd voices: The impact of online grooming and sexual abuse, Universal Journal of Psychology, 1, 2, pp. 59-71, (2013); Chiu M.M., Seigfried-Spellar K.C., Ringenberg T.R., Exploring detection of contact vs. fantasy online sexual offenders in chats with minors: Statistical discourse analysis of self-disclosure and emotion words, Child Abuse & Neglect, 81, pp. 128-138, (2018); Connell R.O., A Typology of Child Cybersexploitation and Online Grooming Practices, (2003); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse & Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Babchishin K.M., Hanson R.K., VanZuylen H., Online child pornography offenders are different: A meta-analysis of the characteristics of online and offline sex offenders against children, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44, 1, pp. 45-66, (2015); Parapar J., Losada D.E., Barreiro A., A learning-based approach for the identification of sexual predators in chat logs, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Barber C., Bettez S., Deconstructing the Online Grooming of Youth: Toward Improved Information Systems for Detection of Online Sexual Predators, (2014); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring highlevel features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); Bayerl P.S., Paul K.I., What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. Previously, Pranoto, Gunawan, and Soewito [1] had developed a logistic model for the purpose and the model was able to achieve 95% detection accuracy. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and fc-nearest neighbors classifiers. In addition, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method on the basis of the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 conversation texts of which 105 texts are grooming and 45 texts are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and fc-NN are able to identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2016 IEEE.",Grooming Classifier; k-nearest Neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Support Vector Machine,Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Computational costs; Detection accuracy; Detection system; Empirical studies; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Computer crime,,,,,,,"Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrap-ping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Whittle H., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A., Collings G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns, Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18, 1, pp. 62-70, (2013); Soewito B., Isa S.M., Digital technology: The effect on connected world to computer ethic and family, CommIT (Communication and Information Technology).

One of the worst forms of cyber-security issues is child grooming, where sexual predators seek contact with minors to abuse them. Various types of organizations such as chat providers and law enforcement are inclined to find online predatory conversations in order to protect the children. This paper proposes a study on predatory conversation detection using Natural Language Processing. We analyzed the different types of features of online grooming data considering various characteristics of online conversation, such as psycho-linguistic patterns. Our experiments with online communication showed an accuracy of 0.98 in automatically classifying the conversations into predatory conversations and non-predatory conversations. Best results are obtained by using linear SVM on 1-gram features when removing stop words as well as by using multinomial Naïve Bayes on 1-gram features when not removing stop words. © 2019 IEEE.",,Cyber security; Linear SVM; Linguistic patterns; Multinomials; NAtural language processing; On-line communication; On-line network; Stop word; Natural language processing systems,,,,,,,"Seto M.C., Pedophilia and sexual offenses against children, Annual Review of Sex Research, 15, 1, pp. 321-361, (2004); Craven S., Brown S., Gilchrist E., Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature and theoretical considerations, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 12, 3, pp. 287-299, (2006); Egan V., Hoskinson J., Shewan D., Perverted justice: A content analysis of the language used by offenders detected attempting to solicit children for sex, Antisocial Behavior: Causes, Correlations and Treatments, 20, 3, (2011); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF, 30, (2012); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007), pp. 235-241, (2007); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes-Y Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Parapar J., Losada D.E., Barreiro A., A learning-based approach for the identification of sexual predators in chat logs, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Krzyzak A., Recognizing predatory chat documents using semi-supervised anomaly detection, Electronic Imaging, 2016, 17, pp. 1-9, (2016); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Sparck Jones K., A statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval, Journal of Documentation, 28, 1, pp. 11-21, (1972); Robertson S., Understanding inverse document frequency: On theoretical arguments for idf, Journal of Documentation, 60, 5, pp. 503-520, (2004); Zhang W., Yoshida T., Tang X., A comparative study of tf∗ idf, lsi and multi-words for text classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 3, pp. 2758-2765, (2011); Nijman H., Merckelbach H., Cima M., Performance intelligence, sexual offending and psychopathy, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 15, 3, pp. 319-330, (2009); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Lorenzo-Dus N., Izura C., Cause ur special"": Understanding trust and complimenting behaviour in online grooming discourse, Journal of Pragmatics, 112, pp. 68-82, (2017); Joachims T., Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features, European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 137-142, (1998)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"2019 International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies, CSET 2019",27 October 2019 through 29 October 2019,Doha,155091.0,,978-172814538-9,,,English,"Int.

Providers and law enforcement tend to use these huge logs anonymously for automatic online Sexual Predator Identification (SPI) which is a relatively new area of application. The task plays an important role in protecting children and juveniles against being exploited by online predators. Pattern recognition techniques facilitate automatic identification of harmful conversations in cyber space by law enforcements. These techniques usually require a large volume of high-quality training instances of both predatory and non-predatory documents. However, collecting non-predatory documents is not practical in real-world applications, since this category contains a large variety of documents with many topics including politics, sports, science, technology and etc. We utilized a new semi-supervised approach to mitigate this problem by adapting an anomaly detection technique called One-class Support Vector Machine which does not require non-predatory samples for training. We compared the performance of this approach against other state-of-the-art methods which use both positive and negative instances. We observed that although anomaly detection approach utilizes only one class label for training (which is a very desirable property in practice); its performance is comparable to that of binary SVM classification. In addition, this approach outperforms the classic two-class Naïve Bayes algorithm, which we used as our baseline, in terms of both classification accuracy and precision. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,Automation; Information retrieval; Law enforcement; Pattern recognition; Selenium compounds; Support vector machines; Automatic identification; Bayes algorithms; Classification accuracy; Detection approach; Negative instances; One-class support vector machine; Pattern recognition techniques; State-of-the-art methods; Anomaly detection,,,,,,,"Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at PAN-2012, CLEF (working Notes), (2012); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes-Y-Gomez M., Villasenor-Pineda L., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, Rome, (2012); Morris C., Identifying online sexual predators by SVM classification with lexical and behavioral features, Master of Science Thesis, (2013); Pendar N., Toward Spotting the Pedophile Telling Victim from Predator in Text Chats, pp. 235-241, (2007); Kontostathis A., Toward the tracking and categorization of internet predators, Proceeding of Text Mining Workshop 2009 Held in Conjunction With Ninth Siam International Conference Data Mining, (2009); Mcghee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Mcbride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, Int.

The existing data-driven approaches usually face the challenges of lack of training data and the uncertainty of classes in terms of the classification or decision boundary. This paper proposes a grooming detection approach in an effort to address such uncertainty based on a data set derived from a publicly available profiling data set. In particular, the approach firstly applies the conventional text feature extraction approach in identifying the most significant words in the data set. This is followed by the application of a fuzzy-rough feature selection approach in reducing the high dimensions of the selected words for fast processing, which at the same time addressing the uncertainty of class boundaries. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting child grooming. © 2018 IEEE.",,Classification (of information); Digital forensics; Fuzzy systems; Learning systems; Text processing; Data-driven approach; Decision boundary; Detection approach; Fast Processing; High dimensions; Intensive research; Machine learning communities; Text classification; Feature extraction,,,,,,,"Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Foc C., Kalkan G., Barnardo's Online Grooming Survey 2016, (2016); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, 2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869, (2011); Lillis D., Becker B.A., O'Sullivan T., Scanlon M., Current challenges and future research areas for digital forensic investigation, Annual ADFSL Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law, (2016); Gunawan F.E., Ashianti L., Candra S., Soewito B., Detecting online child grooming conversation, 2016 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), pp. 1-6, (2016); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Salton G., Developments in automatic text retrieval, Science, 253, 5023, pp. 974-980, (1991); Michalski R.S., Carbonell J.G., Mitchell T.M., Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach, (2013); Yang L., Shen Q., Closed form fuzzy interpolation, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 225, pp. 1-22, (2013); Li J., Yang L., Qu Y., Sexton G., An extended takagi-sugeno-kang inference system (tsk+) with fuzzy interpolation and its rule base generation, Soft Computing, 22, 10, pp. 3155-3170, (2018); Yang L., Chao F., Shen Q., Generalized adaptive fuzzy rule interpolation, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 25, 4, pp. 839-853, (2017); Qu Y., Rong Y., Deng A., Yang L., Associated multi-label fuzzy-rough feature selection, 2017 Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (IFSA-SCIS), pp. 1-6, (2017); Mac Parthalain N., Jensen R., Fuzzy-rough feature selection using flock of starlings optimisation, Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-8, (2015); Jensen R., Shen Q., New approaches to fuzzy-rough feature selection, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 17, 4, pp. 824-838, (2009); Mac Parthalain N., Jensen R., Shen Q., Zwiggelaar R., Fuzzy-rough approaches for mammographic risk analysis, Intell.

In this paper, for the first time, we looked at how quick a predator could be detected, and found that in most cases 26-161 messages of a conversation were sufficient. This constitutes only a small fraction of the full conversations, showing that we can have an early detection system of sexual predators instead of knowing in retrospect that a child was the victim of a sexual predator. © 2019 IEEE.",,Social networking (online); Bayes Classifier; Classification algorithm; Early detection system; Feature sets; Features sets; Neural network classifier; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"Ngejane C.H., Mabuza-Hocquet G., Eloff J.H.P., Lefophane S., Mitigating online sexual grooming cybercrime on social media using machine learning: A desktop survey, 2018 International Conference on Advances in Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (IcABCD), pp. 1-6, (2018); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC, pp. 235-241, (2007); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at PAN-2012, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, (2012); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes-Y-Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, (2012); Eriksson G., Karlgren J., Features for modelling characteristics of conversations, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, Online Working Notes, (2012); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Gunawan F.E., Ashianti L., Candra S., Soewito B., Detecting online child grooming conversation, 2016 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), pp. 1-6, (2016); Jurafsky D., Martin J.H., Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition, (2009); Bishop C.M., Pattern Recognition Machine Learning, (2006); McDonald G.C., Ridge regression, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics, 1, 1, pp. 93-100, (2009); Van Gerven M., Bohte S.M., Editorial: Artificial neural networks as models of neural information processing, Front.

In particular, adults and minors are able to exchange sexually explicit messages and media via a variety of online platforms that are widely available, which leads to an increasing concern of child grooming. Traditionally, the identification of child grooming relies on the analysis and localisation of conversation texts, but this is usually time-consuming and associated with other implications such as psychological pressure on the investigators. Therefore, automatic methods to detect grooming conversations have attracted the attention of many researchers. This paper proposes such a system to identify child grooming in online chat conversations, where the training data of the system were harvested from publicly available information. The data processing is based on a group of AI technologies, including fuzzy-rough feature selection and fuzzy twin support vector machine. Evaluation shows the promise of the proposed approach in identifying online grooming conversations to be implemented in the future after further development to support real-world cases. © 2019 IEEE.",,Data handling;

In this paper, we describe the novel application of a deep learning method to the automatic identification of predatory chat conversations in large volumes of chat logs. We present a classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address this problem domain. The proposed CNN architecture outperforms other classification techniques that are common in this domain including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and regular Neural Network (NN) in terms of classification performance, which is measured by F1-score. In addition, our experiments show that using existing pre-trained word vectors are not suitable for this specific domain. Furthermore, since the learning algorithm runs in a massively parallel environment (i.e., general-purpose GPU), the approach can benefit a large number of computation units (neurons) compared to when CPU is used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CNNs are adapted and applied to this application domain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Language model; Online predator identification; Predatory conversation; Support vector machine; Word embedding,Automation; Convolution; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Program processors; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Language model; Predatory conversation; Word embedding; Support vector machines,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (N00009)","This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ( N00009 ).

In this regard, online sex crimes are among the principal ones to prevent, especially those where a child is abused. The paper at hand proposes C3-Sex, a smart chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with suspects in order to profile their interest regarding online child sexual abuse. This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation. The ACE is designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies that constitute the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and calculate a set of 25 features that describes the suspect’s behavior. After 50 days of experiments, the chatbot generated a dataset with 7199 profiling vectors with the features associated to each suspect. Afterward, we applied an unsupervised method to describe the results that differentiate three groups, which we categorize as indifferent, interested, and pervert. Exhaustive analysis is conducted to validate the applicability and advantages of our solution. © 2020 by the authors.

Earlier studies have majorly employed machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting such conversations. Since deep learning frameworks have shown significant improvements in various text classification tasks, therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based classifier for detecting predatory conversations. Furthermore, instead of designing the system from the beginning, transfer learning has been proposed where the potential of the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is utilized to solve the predator detection problem. BERT is mostly used to encode the textual information of a document into its context-aware mathematical representation. The inclusion of this pre-trained model solves two major problems, i.e. feature extraction and Out of Vocabulary (OOV) terms. The proposed system comprises two components: a pre-trained BERT model and a feed-forward neural network. To design the classification system with a pre-trained BERT model, two approaches (feature-based and fine-tuning) have been used. Based on these approaches two solutions are proposed, namely, BERT_frozen and BERT_tuned where the latter approach is seen performing better than the existing classifiers in terms of F1 and F0.5 -scores. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",BERT; Child grooming; Deep learning; Language modelling; Online sexual predators,Classification (of information); Deep learning; E-learning; Feedforward neural networks; Modeling languages; Text processing; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Child grooming; Deep learning; Language model; Learning approach; Netizen; Online sexual predator; Social media; Transfer learning; Transformer modeling; Support vector machines,,,,,"European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, ERCIM",The work was supported by the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) Alain Bensoussan Fellowship Program.,"Rise in Online Child Sexual Abuse Cases Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic, (2021); Online Grooming of Children for Sexual Purposes: Model Legislation & Global Review.

Social biometric focuses on extracting the pattern a user exhibits while interacting and communicating through social networks. The paper addresses the online sexual predator problem by mining the vocabulary and emotional behavior, which could assist in identifying if the user is a benign or predator. The feature-set consists of vocabulary terms that appear differently in predator and victim content. In order to strengthen the detection model, the paper also focuses on distinguishing the two classes of users based on emotions reflected in their conversation. The experiments are performed on the PAN 2012 corpus. Two datasets are created with respect to vocabulary-based and emotion-based features. The results obtained on the test set have proved that by integrating the vocabulary and emotion-based attributes, the performance of the system is significantly enhanced. While comparing, the proposed approach has outperformed top existing methods by obtaining F1, F2, and F0.5values of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.96 respectively. Furthermore, we also recorded the best accuracy compared to state-of-the-art studies for our proposed SBB-based approach with 99.86%, 99.51%, and 99.88% for Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

A sexual predator is defined as a person who tries to obtain sexual favors in a predatory manner, usually with underage people. The proposed approach uses several text categorization methods and empirical behavioral features developed especially for the task at hand. After investigating various approaches for solving the sexual predator identification problem, we have found that a two-stage classifier achieves the best results. In the first stage, we employ a Support Vector Machine classifier to distinguish conversations having suspicious content from safe online discussions. This is useful as most chat conversations in real life do not contain a sexual predator, therefore it can be viewed as a filtering phase that enables the actual detection of predators to be done only for suspicious chats that contain a sexual predator with a very high degree. In the second stage, we detect which of the users in a suspicious discussion is an actual predator using a Random Forest classifier. The system was tested on the corpus provided by the PAN 2012 workshop organizers and the results are encouraging because, as far as we know, our solution outperforms all previous approaches developed for solving this task. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,Decision trees;

We define and study the task of early sexual predator detection (eSPD) in chats, where the goal is to analyze a running chat from its beginning and predict grooming attempts as early and as accurately as possible. We survey existing datasets and their limitations regarding eSPD, and create a new dataset called PANC for more realistic evaluations. We present strong baselines built on BERT that also reach state-of-the-art results for conventional SPD. Finally, we consider coping with limited computational resources, as real-life applications require eSPD on mobile devices. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Computational resources;

All of the reports strongly suggested that it becomes very urgent to tackle the online child grooming problem in order to protect children from sexual exploitation. Automatic sexual predator identification can be a promising solution to this issue since the number of online conversations is too large to be monitored manually. In this work, a two-stage is proposed with a combination of several features. The first stage is for detecting the predatory conversations while the second step aims to distinguish the predator from the victim in the predatory conversations. The features ensemble used will be combining lexical and behavioral features. The lexical features used include BoW, POS-based, topical, and emotion-based. Meanwhile, the behavioral features used for this work include the number of messages, the average number of words, the number of exclamation marks, the number of questions, sentence complexity and readability, and the number of intentions. SVM was used as a classifier due to its good ability for many text classification tasks. The experiment result shows that BoW with tf - idf term weighting provided the best performance for both PCI and VPD tasks. BoW with tf- idf term weighting obtained an F0.5 score of 0.9893 on PCI and 0.9798 on VPD. The features ensemble can exceed most of the individual features that form it but still cannot beat BoW. © 2023 IEEE.",Bag of Words; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Sexual Predator; SVM,Classification (of information); Text processing; Average numbers; Bag of words; Behavioral features; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Lexical features; Sexual predator; SVM; Term weighting; Support vector machines,,,,,,,"Wachs S., Wolf K.D., Pan C.-C., Cybergrooming: Risk factors, coping strategies and associations with cyberbullying, Psicothema, 24, 4, pp. 628-633, (2012); Choo K.-K.R., Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences, 103, (2009); Kierkegaard S., Cybering, online grooming and ageplay, Computer Law & Security Review, 24, 1, pp. 41-55, (2008); Clement J., Internet usage of teenagers in the united states - statistics facts, (2019); Britain G., Children and parents: Media use and attitudes report, (2013); Madigan S., Villani V., Azzopardi C., Laut D., Smith T., Temple J.R., Browne D., Dimitropoulos G., The prevalence of unwanted online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth: A meta-analysis, Journal of Adolescent Health, 63, 2, pp. 133-141, (2018); Vilarino D., Castillo E., Pinto D., Olmos I., Leon S., Information retrieval and classification based approaches for the sexual predator identification; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, 2019 International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET).

A number of approaches have been proposed to analyze the content of the messages to identify predatory conversations. However, due to the non-availability of large-scale predatory data, the state-of-the-art works employ a standard dataset that has less than 10% predatory conversations. Dealing with such heavy class imbalance is a challenge to devise reliable predatory detection approaches. We present a new approach for dealing with class imbalance using a hybrid sampling and class re-distribution to obtain an augmented dataset. To further improve the diversity of classifiers and features in the ensembles, we also propose to perturb the data along with augmentation in an iterative manner. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate an improvement of 3% over the best state-of-the-art approach and results in an F1-score of 0.99 and an Fβ of 0.94 from the proposed approach. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

CSA can happen in several places, such as schools, households, hostels, and other public spaces. However, a large number of people, including parents, do not have an awareness of this sensitive issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used in various disciplines in the modern era. Hence, supervised machine learning models have been used to predict child sexual abuse awareness in this study. The dataset contains answers provided by 3002 people regarding CSA. A questionnaire dataset obtained though crowdsourcing has been used to predict a person’s knowledge level regarding sexual abuse in children. Heterogenous ML and deep learning models have been used to make accurate predictions. To demystify the decisions made by the models, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have also been utilized. XAI helps in making the models more interpretable, decipherable, and transparent. Four XAI techniques: Shapley additive values (SHAP), Eli5, QLattice, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), have been utilized to demystify the models. Among all the classifiers, the final stacked model obtained the best results with an accuracy of 94% for the test dataset. The excellent results demonstrated by the classifiers point to the use of artificial intelligence in preventing child sexual abuse by making people aware of it. The models can be used real time in facilities such as schools, hospitals, and other places to increase awareness among people regarding sexual abuse in children. © The Author(s) 2023.",Artificial intelligence; Child sexual abuse; Child sexual abuse awareness; Explainable artificial intelligence; Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME); Shapley additive values (SHAP); Supervised machine learning,,,,,,,,"Al-Shehari T., Alsowail R.A., An insider data leakage detection using one-hot encoding, synthetic minority oversampling and machine learning techniques, Entropy, 23, 10, (2021); Amrit C., Paauw T., Aly R., Lavric M., Identifying child abuse through text mining and machine learning, Expert Systems with Applications, 1, 88, pp. 402-418, (2017); Angelov P.P., Soares E.A., Jiang R., Arnold N.I., Atkinson P.M., Explainable artificial intelligence: An analytical review, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 11, 5, (2021); Arena S., Florian E., Zennaro I., Orru P.F., Sgarbossa F., A novel decision support system for managing predictive maintenance strategies based on machine learning approaches, Safety Science, 146, (2022); Assink M., van der Put C.E., Meeuwsen M.W., de Jong N.M., Oort F.J., Stams G.J., Hoeve M., Risk factors for child sexual abuse victimization: A meta-analytic review, Psychological Bulletin, 145, 5, (2019); Chadaga K., Prabhu S., Sampathila N., Chadaga R., Ks S., Sengupta S., Predicting cervical cancer biopsy results using demographic and epidemiological parameters: A custom stacked ensemble machine learning approach, Cogent Engineering, 9, 1, (2022); Christ C., De Waal M.M., Dekker J.J., van Kuijk I., Van Schaik D.J., Kikkert M.J., Goudriaan A.E., Beekman A.T., Messman-Moore T.L., Linking childhood emotional abuse and depressive symptoms: The role of emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems, PloS One, 14, 2, (2019); Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, .

For their education, children require access to the internet, as well as a standard institutional ICT infrastructure, including e-mail and other forms of online communication technology. Given the sheer volume of data being generated and shared on a daily basis within schools, most teachers and DSLs can no longer monitor the safety and wellbeing of their students without the use of specialist safeguarding software. In this paper, we experiment with the use of stateof-the-art neural network models on the modelling of a dataset of almost 9,000 anonymised child-generated chat messages on the Microsoft Teams platform. The dataset was manually annotated into two binary classes: true positives (real safeguarding concerns) and false positives (false alarms) that a monitoring program would be interested in. These classes were then further annotated into eight fine-grained classes of safeguarding concerns (or false alarms). For the binary classification, we achieved a macro F1 score of 87.32, while for the fine-grained classification, our models achieved a macro F1 score of 73.56. This first experiment into the use of Deep Learning for detecting safeguarding concerns represents an important step towards achieving high-accuracy and reliable monitoring information for busy teachers and safeguarding leads. © 2023 Incoma Ltd.
