Due to hectic schedules and daily struggles, time is limited for parents. For that reason, the AI-powered child protection system helps protect children from modern cyber-attacks while offering parents more control over their children. Keyloggers, keystroke and mouse movement loggers help to collect data and can record user behaviour and find patterns. Furthermore, the use of those records is able to detect children’s improper behaviour and reveal children’s emotional states. Behavioral Data Extractor and Risk Analysis systems can analyze huge numbers of URLs and web content recorded by proxy, as well as application usage and screen times collected by background service. The Smart Resource Restricter is designed to help parents and children navigate the web safely and appropriately. The research can identify and prevent child predators. Indeed, cyberbullying and phishing attacks cross many boundaries, causing great harm to the community. It blocks outside threats and notifies parents of sexual and other online predators that often target children. The PandaGuardian successfully achieved its goal with the assistance of different algorithms and the respective outcomes. The model evaluation report, which compares all the methods, is a guardian companion. Parents could get assistance in order to safeguard their children from the day-to-day evolving cyber threats.",,978-1-6654-0690-1,10.1109/UEMCON53757.2021.9666696,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666696,Smart resource restrictor;human feedback ex-tractor;child protection;cyberbullying;phishing;random forest;keylogger;mouse movement;artificial intelligent;behavioral data extractor,Schedules;Navigation;Phishing;Forestry;Mobile communication;Feature extraction;Mice,,3.0,,29.0,IEEE,10 Jan 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
A Big Data Science Experiment -- Identity Deception Detection,v. d. W. van der Walt; J. H. P. Eloff,"Department of Computer Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, ZA; Department of Computer Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa",2015 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI),3 Mar 2016,2015,,,416,419,"Identity Deception Detection is a problem on social media platforms today. Not only is there challenges towards determining the authenticity of people, but also with analyzing the data that forms part of the communications. These data are of heterogeneous type and include photos, videos and sound. Furthermore, most social media platforms are operating in an uncontrolled environment. Any person can contribute content and take part. Even though age restrictions do exist there are no enforcement of these laws and honesty of the public is expected. This is dangerous for minors specifically as they are either unaware of the dangers or not mature enough to be responsible for their actions online. Online predators are aware of this fact and targeting this group specifically. This paper presents work-in-progress towards developing an intelligent Identity Deception Indicator (IDI). It is envisaged that this work could eventually assists authorities in doing large-scale observation on publicly available social media platforms, such as Twitter. Of particular interest are those personas whose behavior and online content does not fit with the age group they are conversing with.",,978-1-4673-9795-7,10.1109/CSCI.2015.169,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424127,Identity deception;Big Data;Data Science;Cyber-security;Social media,Big data;Media;Computer security;Technological innovation;Convergence;Twitter,,,,20.0,IEEE,3 Mar 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
