Although it is rather commonly known that cyberspace is a battlefield, and almost every individual, organization or even state may fall victim to malicious hackers or greedy cybercriminals, the members of the public rarely seem to think of other sources of threat. Thus, in an attempt to raise the general awareness, this paper presents an additional number of selected, often unsuspected actors that shape and influence the cyberspace of today: nation-state actors, cyberterrorists, hacktivists and trolls. The motives of each actor, their modus operandi and the most significant representatives have also been discussed. Being aware of the existence and nature of each actor helps one better understand the threat they pose, as well as grasp the significance of the cybersecurity measures. © 2020 ACM.",Cyber threat; Cyberspace; Cyberspace actors; Cyberterrorists; Hacktivists; Nation-state actors; Trolls,Personal computing; Security of data; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cybercriminals; Cyberspaces; Modus operandi; Computers,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (833042)","Funding text 1: This work is funded under SIMARGL project, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 833042.; Funding text 2: This work is funded under SIMARGL project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 833042.","Ablon L., The motivations of cyber threat actors and their use and monetization of stolen data: Hearings before the committee on financial services subcommittee on terrorism and illicit finance, United States House, 115th Cong, (2018); Addawood A., Badawy A., Lerman K., Ferrara E., Linguistic cues to deception: Identifying political trolls on social media, Proceedings of the Thirteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2019), (2019); Afifi-Sabet K., What Is Hacktivism?, (2018); Ahmad R., Yunos Z., A dynamic cyber terrorism framework, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, (2012); Entity A., Urban Dictionary: Troll, (2002); Cyberterrorism: The invisible threat stealth cyber predators in a climate of escalating risk, Foreign Affairs, 89, (2010); Arthur C., Lulzsec: What they did, who they were and how they were caught, The Guardian, (2013); Baraniuk C., Ten Hacktivists Who Shook the Web, (2013); Beggs C., Cyber-terrorism in Australia, IGI Global, (2008); Benton B., The Misinformers: Edward Snowden, Aaron Swartz and the Troubled Relationship between Hacktivists, Mass Media and American Government, (2015); Bieda D., Halawi L., Cyberspace: A venue for terrorism, Issues in Information Systems, 16, (2015); Bishop J., Tackling Internet Abuse in Great Britain: Towards A Framework for Classifying Severities of 'Flame Trolling', (2012); Bishop J., The effect of de-individuation of the internet troller on criminal procedure implementation: An interview with a hater, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, (2013); Buchan R., Cyberspace , non-state actors and the obligation to prevent transboundary harm, Journal of Conflict & Security Law, (2016); Caldwell T., Hacktivism goes hardcore, Network Security, 2015, 5, pp. 12-17, (2015); Cambria E., Chandra P., Sharma A., Hussain A., Do Not Feel the Trolls, (2010); Charlish A., Polish Deputy Minister Resigns over Judge Trolling Scandal, (2019); What Is Hacktivism?; Coleman G., Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy, (2014); Cook C., Schaafsma J., Antheunis M., Under the bridge: An in-depth examination of online trolling in the gaming context, New Media & Society, 20, 9, pp. 3323-3340, (2018); Denning D.E., Cyberterrorism Testimony before the Special Oversight Panel on Terrorism Committee on Armed Services U.S. House of Representatives, (2000); Dogan B., Contextualizing hacktivism: The criminalization of redhack, CARGC Papers, 10, (2019); Viacheslav Dziundziuk Dr., Stopping cyber terror countries must work together to thwart efforts of internet criminals, Per Concordiam, Journal of European Security and Defense Issues, 2; Eddy M., Cyber warfare is still a free-for-all, PC Magazine, (2019); Fowler K., Data Breach Preparation and Response, (2016); Gargano F., Three Common Threat Actors and the One You Might Not Know about, (2019); Gerber T.P., Zavisca J., Does Russian propaganda work?, The Washington Quarterly, 39, 2, pp. 79-98, (2016); Onet.pl: Deputy Justice Minister behind Campaign to Discredit Judges, (2019); Goldman Z.K., Terrorism 2.0?

Yet, research exploring how the language used by such individuals might reflect their psychological world is scarce. Interestingly, researchers have largely assumed that adults who engage in OG behaviours create a deceptive relationship to reach sexual intent. However, no study to date has investigated the deceptive component of these interactions. Objective: To explore the psycholinguistic and deceptive properties of chats where OG is present, from the perspective of front-line specialists. Participants and Setting: Prison staff (n = 7) and police officers (n = 9) and sixty-five chat logs from adults convicted of an online sexual offence against a minor. Methods: A mixed-method approach was employed, whereby qualitative (focus groups) data collection informed subsequent quantitative (the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)) data analyse of adult-child online sexual chats, using the model of OG discourse as the theoretical rationale. Results: Specialist considered that the online abuse/exploitation of minors can occur without deception. Adults who engage in OG behaviour use language that denotes affiliation with a positive emotional tone (p = .003, ηp2 = .59). The communicative focus is the development of an interpersonal relationship, above engagement in sexual talk (p < .001, ηp2 = .96). Conclusions: Findings challenge the common perception that the relationship is centred on deception and identify the intention of some adults as the development of a perceived genuine interpersonal relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Child sexual offenders; Deception; Online grooming; Psycho-linguistics,"Adult; Animals; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Communication; Emotions; Humans; Internet; Interpersonal Relations; Language; Linguistics; Male; Pedophilia; Police; Prisons; United Kingdom; adult; article; child; comparative study; controlled study; conversation; deception; female; grooming; human; human experiment; human relation; language; major clinical study; male; perception; police; prison; psycholinguistics; quantitative analysis; sexual crime; theoretical study; animal; child sexual abuse; comparative study; correctional facility; emotion; Internet; interpersonal communication; linguistics; pedophilia; police; psychology; United Kingdom",,,,,S wansea University; Swansea University,"Funding text 1: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
