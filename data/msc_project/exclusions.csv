Visual data can incriminate or exonerate; they can shape and reshape public opinion. Visual evidence can legitimize certain accounts of events while calling others into question. The proliferation of visual data creates challenges for the law at multiple points of entry: recording, distribution or disclosure, redaction or deletion, or use as evidence. This symposium outlines and analyzes legal challenges posed by recent developments in visual data technologies and practices. This introductory essay and the articles that follow highlight legal issues that arise when state actors collect visual data and when visual data are used in legal disputes. Technological development is outpacing empirical research on, and legal regulation of, visual data within society and inside the courtroom. This symposium provides a much-needed opportunity to highlight new legal and empirical research at the intersection of visual data and law. © 2018 American Bar Foundation.",,,,,,,"John D. and Catherine T.

Children at increasingly younger ages come into contact with electronic devices, exposing them to cyberbullying and grooming. The article focuses on a theoretical and practical analysis of child grooming in the context of contemporary technologies and identifies challenges related to education in today’s system. Various forms of cyberbullying, such as trolling, hate speech, sexting, and grooming, are discussed in the article. These experiences can lead to serious emotional and social consequences, even to suicide attempts. Special attention is given to child grooming, a process of building a relationship with a child for sexual exploitation, which poses an increasing threat to the youngest users of the Internet. The authors draw attention to the potential dangers of internet applications that allow perpetrators to hide their identity and establish private contacts with children. They also describe the role of schools in the digital world of children, emphasizing the need for education on online safety, the development of digital citizen-ship skills, and collaboration with parents. The authors concludes with a discussion of educational challenges related to child grooming and advocates for the creation of a separate school subject dedicated to online safety, ethics, awareness of threats, and cri-sis management skills in cyberspace. This proposal includes diverse modules such as basics of online safety, privacy protection, cyberbullying, online law, and safe use of modern technologies, aiming to comprehensively prepare students for internet use. © 2023, the Authors.",cyberbullying; education; hate speech; sexting; trolling,,,,,,,,"Bak A., Jak małe dzieci korzystają z urządzeń mobilnych?

There is little research into non-offending MAPs, a group whose experiences offer valuable insights into the prevention of child abuse.

Engaging interactions, such as likes, shares, and replies, between users are the key determinants of these platforms’ news feed prioritization algorithms. These interactions attract people to ongoing debates and help inform and shape their opinions. Since being influential and attracting followers in these debates are considered as important, understanding the automation of these processes becomes critical in order to contribute positively. In this work, we aim to train a chatbot system that classifies tweets according to their positions, and it can also generate tweets related to a conversation. In this study, we test our system on a recently popular topic, namely the gun control debate in the U.S. Chatbots, are trained to tweet independently for their side and also reply meaningfully to a tweet from the opposite side. State-of-the-art architectures are tested to obtain a more accurate classification. We applied GloVe embedding model for representing tweets. Instead of using handcrafted features, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is applied to these embeddings to get more informative and equal-sized feature vectors. This model is trained to encode a tweet as a sequence of embeddings. Encoding is used for both message classification and generation tasks. LSTM sequence-to-sequence model is used to generate topical tweets and replies to tweets. We develop a new salience metric for measuring the relatedness of a generated message to a target tweet. Additionally, human evaluations are performed to measure the quality of the chatbot generated tweets according to their topic relevance and bias, and the quality of its replies to target tweets. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Tweet classification; Tweet generation; Twitter bot,Embeddings; Encoding (symbols); Network architecture; Quality control; Social networking (online); Feature vectors; Human evaluation; Key determinants; Micro-blogging platforms; Prioritization; Sequence modeling; State of the art; Topic relevance; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,"Adiwardana D., Luong M.-T., So D.R., Hall J., Fiedel N., Thoppilan R., Yang Z., Kulshreshtha A., Nemade G., Lu Y., Towards a Human-Like Open-Domain Chatbot, (2020); Antipov G., Baccouche M., Dugelay J., Face aging with conditional generative adversarial networks, 2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2017, (2017); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, 3Rd International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2015, Conference Track Proceedings, (2015); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation, J Mach Learn Res, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching word vectors with subword information, Trans Assoc Comput Linguist, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Bradesko L., Mladenic D., A survey of Chatbot systems through a Loebner prize competition, Proceedings of Slovenian Language Technologies Society Eighth Conference of Language Technologies, pp. 34-37, (2012); Brandtzaeg P.B., Folstad A., Chatbots: changing user needs and motivations, Interactions, 25, 5, pp. 38-43, (2018); Brixey J., Hoegen R., Lan W., Rusow J., Singla K., Yin X., Artstein R., Leuski A., Shihbot: A facebook chatbot for sexual health information on HIV/AIDS, Proceedings of the 18Th Annual Sigdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, Saarbrücken, Germany, August 15–17, 2017, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 370-373, (2017); Chavoshi N., Hamooni H., Mueen A., Identifying correlated bots in twitter, Social informatics—8th International Conference, Proceedings, Part II, Volume of 10047 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 14-21, (2016); Chen H., Liu X., Yin D., Tang J., A survey on dialogue systems: recent advances and new frontiers, SIGKDD Explor, 19, 2, pp. 25-35, (2017); Chen C., Mu S., Xiao W., Ye Z., Wu L., Ju Q., Improving image captioning with conditional generative adversarial nets, The Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2019, the Thirty-First Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, pp. 8142-8150, (2019); Chollampatt S., Ng H.T., A multilayer convolutional encoder-decoder neural network for grammatical error correction, Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Cho K., van Merrienboer B., Bahdanau D., Bengio Y., On the properties of neural machine translation: Encoder-decoder approaches, Proceedings of SSST@EMNLP 2014, Eighth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation, pp. 103-111, (2014); Cui R., Agrawal G., Ramnath R., Tweets can tell: activity recognition using hybrid gated recurrent neural networks, Soc Netw Anal Min, 10, 1, pp. 1-15, (2020); Cui L., Huang S., Wei F., Tan C., Duan C., Zhou M., Superagent: A customer service chatbot for e-commerce websites, Proceedings of the 55Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 97-102, (2017); Demirel B., Cinbis R.G., Ikizler-Cinbis N., Image captioning with unseen objects, 30Th British Machine Vision Conference, (2019); Denkowski M.J., Lavie A., Meteor 1.3: Automatic metric for reliable optimization and evaluation of machine translation systems, Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, WMT@EMNLP 2011, pp. 85-91, (2011); Dumais S.T., Furnas G.W., Landauer T.K., Deerwester S., Harshman R., Using latent semantic analysis to improve access to textual information, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 281-285, (1988); Ebrahimi M., Automatic Identification of Online Predators in Chat Logs by Anomaly Detection and Deep Learning, (2016); Ertugrul A.M., Karagoz P., Movie genre classification from plot summaries using bidirectional LSTM, 12Th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, ICSC 2018, pp. 248-251, (2018); Ertugrul A.M., Velioglu B., Karagoz P., Word Embedding Based Event Detection on Social Media.

This study presents a method for recognizing human emotions using LogNNet neural network and keystroke dynamics dataset. Two types of training sets were investigated, with 10 and 15 features compiled on the basis of the Emosurv database, an assessment of recognition metrics was given (accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1). It is shown that the accuracy of recognition of one emotion out of 5 (happy, sad, angry, calm, neutral state) reaches 33.4% when using 10 features read only from the keyboard.

A range of online sexual activities may be of interest in forensic mental health evaluations (FMHE), including those which are clearly illegal or those which are legal but functionally problematic. Online sexual offenses will clearly prompt forensic evaluators to consider the role of the Internet in these offending behaviors. The Internet may also be relevant in forensic evaluations of contact sexual offending including informing on history of mixed or cross-over offending, and Internet-facilitated contact offenses. A review of Internet-data may span several online domains, many of which provide the user with substantial anonymity and would likely not be available to the evaluator unless provided through the process of discovery. Early guidelines for the review of Internet-data in FMHEs have been proposed and support the Internet as a useful source of collateral data in the conduct of forensic evaluations of sexual behavior. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CSEM; FMHE; guidelines; internet; online child pornography; online sexual activities (OSA); online sexual solicitation; sexual behavior; sexual violence,Criminals; Forensic Psychiatry; Forensic Psychology; Humans; Internet; Mental Health; Sex Offenses; Sexual Behavior; article; child pornography; cybergrooming; diagnosis; female; human; Internet; male; mental health; practice guideline; sexual behavior; sexual crime; sexual violence; sexuality; therapy; forensic psychiatry; forensic psychology; mental health; offender; procedures; psychology; sexual crime,,,,,,,"Acar K.V., Webcam child prostitution: An exploration of current and futuristic methods of detection, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 11, 1, pp. 98-109, (2020); APA committee on professional practice and standards, (2021); The principles of medical ethics: With annotations especially applicable to psychiatry, (2013); APA commentary on ethics in practice, (2015); Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, (2022); Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct (2002, Amended June 1, 2010), (2010); Specialty guidelines for forensic psychology, American Psychologist, 68, 1, pp. 7-19, (2013); APA task force on psychological assessment and evaluation guidelines, (2020); Arkfeld M.R., Arkfeld on electronic discovery and evidence, (2015); Babchishin K.M., Haonson R.K., Hermann C., The characteristics of online sex offenders: A meta-analysis, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 23, 1, pp. 92-123, (2011); Babchishin K.M., Hanson R.K., VanZuylen H., Online child pornography offenders are different: A meta-analysis of the characteristics of online and offline sex offenders against children, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44, 1, pp. 45-66, (2015); Ballester-Arnal R., Garcia-Barba M., Castro-Calvo J., Gimenez-Garcia C., Gil-Llario M.D., Pornography consumption in people of different age groups: An analysis based on gender, contents, and consequences, Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 20, 2, pp. 766-779, (2022); Barros A.J.S., Teche S.P., Padoan C., Laskoski P., Hauck S., Eizirik C.L., Countertransference, defense mechanisms, and vicarious trauma in work with sexual offenders, Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and Law, 48, 3, pp. 1-13, (2020); Batastini A.B., Jones A.C.T., Miller O.K., Vitacco M.J., An introduction to Internet-based data and its relevance to forensic mental health assessments, FMHEs in the digital age, pp. 1-22, (2020); Batastini A.B., Vitacco M.J., Bozeman A.R., General recommendations for integrating Internet-based data in forensic mental health assessments and what we still need to know, FMHEs in the digital age, pp. 227-238, (2020); Batastini A.B., Vitacco M.J., FMHEs in the digital age: A practitioner’s guide to using Internet-based data, (2020); Bekkers L.M., Leukfeldt E.R., Holt T.J., Online communities for child-attracted persons as informal mental health care: Exploring self-reported wellbeing outcomes.

Yet, they are still struggling to incorporate basic social ideas for many different and new online activities. This has resulted in unintended exposure of users’ personal data and a rise in online threats as users have now become a desirable target for malicious activities. To address such challenges, various researchers have argued that STS should support user-oriented configurations to protect their users from online social abuse. Some methodologies have also been proposed to appreciate the integration of social values in the design of information systems, but they often lack an application mechanism. This paper presents a framework for the application of the socio-technical design methodology to incorporate social standards in the design of STS. The proposed framework exemplifies the socio-technical design approach by considering a list of social standards, followed by their mapping onto corresponding technical specifications. Based on these two sets, the framework highlights various individual, inter-group, and intra-group interactions and their supporting tools for STS governance. A conversation about the integration of social standards in STS is already materializing, therefore, a comprehensive framework to apply these standards in STS is entailed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Cyberspace; Online rights; Online standards; Rights management; Socio-technical design; System design,Online systems; Social networking (online); Cyberspaces; Design Methodology; Online activities; Online right; Online standard; Rights management; Social interactions; Social standards; Socio-technical designs; Sociotechnical systems; Design,,,,,,,"Ahmad A., Azhar A., Naqvi S., Nawaz A., Arshad S., Zeshan F., A methodology for sender-oriented anti-spamming, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 38, 3, pp. 2765-2776, (2019); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Janczewski L., Ali M., Chaudary M.H., Friedman R., A relation-aware multiparty access control, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 37, 1, pp. 227-239, (2019); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Distributed access control for social networks, International Conference of Information Assurance and Security, pp. 68-73, (2011); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Bertino E., Friedman R., Extending social networks with delegation, Computers & Security, 70, pp. 546-564, (2017); How Do App Stores Challenge the Global Internet Governance Ecosystem?, In IEEE Internet Computing (Vol, 20, 6, pp. 49-51, (2016); Baraniuk C., Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam, BBC News, 28Th April 2019., (2017); Beer D., Burrows R., Sociology and, of and in Web 2.0: Some Initial Considerations, Sociological Research Online, 12, 5, (2007); Beu D., Buckley M.R., The hypothesized relationship between accountability and ethical behavior, Journal of Business Ethics, 34, 1, pp. 57-74, (2001); Bird P., Accountability: Standards in financial reporting, (1973); Bonahoom O.M., Moral and ethical considerations in tax practice, Marquette Law Review, 37, 1, (1953); Bovens M., Goodin R.E., Schillemans T., The Oxford handbook public accountability, (2014); Brandom R., Is Facebook’s photo-tagging system violating privacy law?, The Verge, (2015); Broadbent J., Laughlin R., Control and legitimation in government accountability processes: The private finance initiative in the UK, Critical Perspectives on Accounting., 14, 1-2, pp. 23-48, (2003); Cahn A., Alfeld S., Barford P., Muthukrishnan S., An Empirical Study of Web Cookies, In Proceedings of the 25Th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW '16).

This chapter identifies this digital abuse phenomenon by comparing and contrasting face-to-face versus digital sexual harassment. More specifically, this chapter contributes to the understanding of haptic communication and sexual harassment, or sexual harassment that occurs using physical touch behavior in combination with virtual touch in both physical and virtual settings in social interactions. The negative effects of digital sexual harassment emphasized in this chapter include mental, emotional, and social consequences that may be detrimental to a person’s quality of life. As sexual harassment through haptic communication continues to impact workers in organizations, researchers and practitioners may need to develop strategies to cope with this form of abuse. Future directions for haptic communication sexual harassment scholarship are also discussed. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Lisa M.

Some social content violates the integrity and dignity of users, therefore, this task has become challenging. The need to deal with short texts, poorly written language, unbalanced classes, and non-thematic aspects. These can lead to overfitting in deep neural network (DNN) models used for classification tasks. Empirical evidence in previous studies indicates that some of these problems can be overcome by improving the optimization process of the DNN weights to avoid overfitting. Moreover, a well-defined learning process in the input examples could improve the order of the patterns learned throughout the optimization process. In this paper, we propose four Curriculum Learning strategies and a new Hybrid Genetic–Gradient Algorithm that proved to improve the performance of DNN models detecting the class of interest even in highly imbalanced datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Curriculum Learning; Deep neural networks; Genetic algorithm; Natural language processing; Optimization process; Text classification,Classification (of information); Curricula; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Curriculum learning; Evolutionary optimizations; Exponential growth; Language processing; Learning optimizations; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural network model; Overfitting; Text classification; Deep neural networks,,,,,"CIMAT Bajio Supercomputing Laboratory, (300832, BP-FP-20201015143044227-814705); Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas; Desarrollo de Inteligencia Artificial, (11989, 1311, 2020-01, 314967, 617); Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT; Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica, INAOE","Funding text 1: Some important parts of this work were supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas and Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica through project fund and Grants (declared in the Acknowledgments section). ; Funding text 2: The authors thank Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT), Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT) and Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE) for the computer resources provided through the INAOE Supercomputing Laboratory’s Deep Learning Platform for Language Technologies (Laboratorio de Supercómputo: Plataforma de Aprendizaje Profundo) with the project “Identification of Aggressive and Offensive text through specialized BERT’s ensembles” and CIMAT Bajio Supercomputing Laboratory (#300832).

An online survey was conducted where participants (N = 202) were provided with three different visualizations of the detection screen (labeled text only, percentage of abusive text messages only, and labeled and percentage of abusive text messages) to understand a) What is the threshold of abusive text messages that would motivate the user to consider themselves in an abusive relationship? (30%, 50%, or 70% abusive text messages) b) What is the most effective way to visualize the results of the detection classifier that would invoke user trust and encourage them to receive necessary help? c) Which visualizations nudge users to trust machine learning-based classification results?

Clear focus on the ethical risks of this research is critical given that those risks are disproportionately born by already vulnerable populations. To understand and subsequently address these risks, we conducted a systematic literature review of computing research leveraging AI to combat human trafficking and apply a framework using principles from international human rights law to categorize ethical risks. This paper uncovers a number of ethical tensions including bias endemic in datasets, privacy risks stemming from data collection and reporting, and issues concerning potential misuse. We conclude by highlighting four suggestions for future research: broader use of participatory design; engaging with other forms of trafficking; developing best practices for harm prevention; and including transparent ethics disclosures in research. We find that there are significant gaps in what aspects of human trafficking researchers have focused on. Most research to date focuses on aiding criminal investigations in cases of sex trafficking, but more work is needed to support other anti-Trafficking activities like supporting survivors, adequately address labor trafficking, and support more diverse survivor populations including transgender and nonbinary individuals. © 2022 ACM.",artificial intelligence; ethics; human rights; human trafficking,Crime; Ethical technology; Social aspects; Best practices; Computing research; Data collection; Data reporting; Human rights; Human trafficking; Intelligence communities; Participatory design; Privacy risks; Systematic literature review; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental, the Philippines; United States of America: Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, (2000); Aizenberg E., Van Den Hoven J., Designing for Human Rights in AI.

Moreover, the majority of experimental investigations have utilized self-reported questionnaires or irrelevant economic games to reflect people’s prosocial behavior instead of measuring prosocial behavior demonstrated in real-life, natural settings. Considering the gaps in past research, this systematic review aims to identify literature regarding the influence of social media on emerging adults’ prosocial behaviors. The review focuses on studies that observed individuals’ prosocial behavior in real-life settings to eliminate social desirability bias and accurately establish the effects of social media on emerging adults’ prosocial behavior. © 2024 The Author(s).

No aspect of life is left untouched and in the world of crime, especially grooming crimes, which target victims who are children, are also experiencing considerable increase. Legal limitations make it difficult for law enforcement officials to carry out more effective law enforcement. This study examines the legal regime and the factors that encourage crime against children. The present research will be an important point of departure as it will influence the work process of law enforcement officers in terms of child care, especially for child victims. This study uses a legal normative method with a qualitative case study approach, a conceptual approach and a legislative approach. The results show that legal arrangements regarding grooming crimes are regulated using different laws, but do not clearly and explicitly address the many important issues around grooming crimes. As a result, law enforcement officials have difficulty interpreting laws in relation to the relevant causal factors, such as the perpetrator, the victim and social factors. © (2023).

Applying an offender-based perspective which considers the central role of convenience, it seeks to inform, improve and develop the current literature on cybercrime, whilst paying particular attention to its founding category within criminology. It argues that white-collar crime has receded from criminological perspectives on cybercrime in recent years and that a detailed, rich re-assessment of white-collar crime in contemporary digital societies is needed. Following a theoretical introduction, the book develops to discuss, inter alia, implications for corporate reputation, the various organizational roles utilized in mitigating external and internal threats, the unique considerations involved in law enforcement efforts, and likely future directions within the field. White-Collar Crime Online recognises the strong lineage and correlation that exists between the study of white-collar crime and cybercrime. Using convenience theory within a comparative analysis which includes case-studies, the book explores both European and American paradigms, perspectives and models to determine where white-collar crime exists within the contemporary workplace and how this might relate to the ongoing discourse on cybercrime. In doing so it revaluates criminological theory within the context of changing patterns of business, the workplace, social rules, systems of governance, decision making, social ordering and control. White-Collar Crime Online will speak to criminologists, sociologists and professionals; including those interested in cyber-security, economics, technology and computer science. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2022.

This requires the potentially computational model for law enforcement authorities to facilitate a detection of human trafficking activities. The machine learning (ML) models have been used to detect these activities mostly rely on text classification and often omit the correction of misspelled words, resulting in the risk of predictions error. Therefore, an improvement data processing approach is one of strategies to enhance an efficiency of human trafficking detection. This paper presents a novel approach to solving spelling mistakes. The approach is designed to select misspelled words, the replace them with the popular words having the same meaning based on an estimation of the probability of words and context used in human trafficking advertisements. The applicability of the proposed approach was demonstrated with the labeled human trafficking dataset using three classification models: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The achievement of higher accuracy of the model predictions using the proposed method evidences an improved alert on human trafficking outperforming than the others. The proposed approach shows the potential applicability to other datasets and domains from the online advertisements. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, such information sharing is not always authentic because people, sometimes, also share their perceptions and fabricated information on OSNs. Thus, verification of online posts is important to maintain reliability over this useful communication medium. To address this concern, multiple approaches have been investigated including machine learning, natural language processing, source authentication, empirical studies, web semantics, and modeling/simulations, but the problem still persists. This research proposes an effective synergy-based rumor verification method along with a weighted-mean reputation management system to mitigate the spread of rumors over OSN. The model was formally verified through Colored Petri-Nets while its semantic behavior was analyzed through ontologies. Moreover, a third-party Facebook application was developed for proof of concept, and users’ acceptance and usability analysis was performed through Technology Acceptance Model and Self-Efficacy scale. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be used as an effective tool for the identification of rumors and it has the potential to improve the quality of users’ online experience. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Colored Petri-Net; Online social networks; Ontology; Rumor verification; Synergy; Web semantics; Weighted reputation management,Information dissemination; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Petri nets; Semantic Web; Semantics; User profile; Colored Petri Nets; Information sharing; Ontology's; Reputation management; Rumor verification; Social connection; Synergy; Verification systems; Web semantics; Weighted reputation management; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Bertino E., Friedman R., Extending social networks with delegation, Comput Secur, 70, pp. 546-564, (2017); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Janczewski L., Ali M., Chaudary M.H., Friedman R., A relation-aware multiparty access control, J Intell Fuzzy Syst, 37, 1, pp. 227-239, (2019); Ahmad A., Azhar A., Naqvi S., Nawaz A., Arshad S., Zeshan F., Salih A.O., A methodology for sender-oriented anti-spamming, J Intell Fuzzy Syst, 38, 3, pp. 2765-2776, (2020); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Bertino E., A framework for the application of socio-technical design methodology, Ethics Inf Technol, 24, 4, (2022); Alpaydin E., Introduction to machine learning, (2009); Anderson M., Hitlin P., Atkinson M., Wikipedia at 15: Millions of readers in scores of languages., (2016); Barboza F.C., Jeong H., Kobayashi K., Shiramatsu S., An ontology-based computational framework for analyzing public opinion framing in news media, 2013 IEEE Int Conf Syst Man Cybern, pp. 2420-2426, (2013); Becker D., Bendett S., Crowdsourcing solutions for disaster response: examples and lessons for the US government, Procedia Eng, 107, pp. 27-33, (2015); Boididou C., Middleton S.E., Jin Z., Papadopoulos S., Dang-Nguyen D.T., Boato G., Kompatsiaris Y., Verifying information with multimedia content on twitter: a comparative study of automated approaches, Multimed Tools Appl, 77, pp. 15545-15571, (2018); Boididou C., Papadopoulos S., Zampoglou M., Apostolidis L., Papadopoulou O., Kompatsiaris Y., Detection and visualization of misleading content on twitter, Int J Multimed Inf Retr, 7, pp. 71-86, (2018); Bordia P., DiFonzo N., When social psychology became less social: Prasad and the history of rumor research, Asian J Soc Psychol, 5, 1, pp. 49-61, (2002); Castillo C., Mendoza M., Poblete B., Information credibility on twitter, Proceedings of the 20Th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 675-684, (2011); Cen J., Li Y., A rumor detection method from social network based on deep learning in big data environment, Comput Intell Neurosci, (2022); Chen X., A real time anti-spamming system in crowdsourcing platform, Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS), 2016 7Th IEEE International Conference On, IEEE, pp. 981-984, (2016); Choudhury D., Acharjee T., A novel approach to fake news detection in social networks using genetic algorithm applying machine learning classifiers, Multimed Tools Appl, 82, pp. 9029-9045, (2023); Chua A.Y., Banerjee S., To share or not to share: the role of epistemic belief in online health rumors, Int J Med Inf, 108, pp. 36-41, (2017); Chua A.Y., Banerjee S., Rumor verifications on facebook: click speech of likes, comments and shares, 2017 Twelfth international conference on digital information management (ICDIM), pp. 257-262, (2017); Clark B.Y., Zingale N., Logan J., Brudney J., A framework for using crowdsourcing in government, Social Entrepreneurship: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, pp. 405-425, (2019); Clayton K., Blair S., Busam J.A., Forstner S., Glance J., Green G., Nyhan B., Real solutions for fake news?

People engage in education, business, shopping, and other social activities (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube). As social networking expands rapidly, its positive and negative impacts affect human health. All this leads to social crimes and illegal activities like phishing, hacking, ransomware, password attacks, spyware, blackmailing, Middle-man-attack. This research extensively discusses the social networking threats, challenges, online surveys, and future effects. We conduct an online survey using the google forms platform to collect the responses of social networking sites (SNS) users within Pakistan to show how SNS affects health positively and negatively. According to the collected response, we analyzed that 50% of the users use SNS for education purposes, 17.5% use it for shopping purposes, 58.2% use it for entertainment, 37.1% use it for communication, and 9.8% use it for other purposes. According to the response, the excessive use of SNS affects the health that 9.8% users face the physical threat, 42.8% user faces mental health issues due to excessive or inappropriate use of SN, and 50.5% users feel moral threat using Social sites. Finally, we conclude our paper by discussing the open challenges, conclusions, and future directions. © 2022 Rabia Abid et al.",,Computer viruses; Health; Health risks; Personal computing; Surveys; Facebook; Human health; Illegal activities; Networking security; Online surveys; Social activities; Social media networks; Social-networking; Systematic literature review; YouTube; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Abbasi A., Javed A.R., Chakraborty C., Nebhen J., Zehra W., Jalil Z., Elstream: An ensemble learning approach for concept drift detection in dynamic social big data stream learning, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 66408-66419, (2021); Sushama C., Kumar M.S., Neelima P., Privacy and Security Issues in the Future: A Social Media, Materials Today Proceedings, (2021); Gapinski C.M., Hermes J., Von Haaren C., Why people like or dislike large wood in rivers - A representative survey of the general public in Germany, River Research and Applications, 37, 2, pp. 187-197, (2021); Shaikh A.H., Meshram B.B., Security issues in cloud computing, Intelligent Computing and Networking, pp. 63-77, (2021); Ayoub A., Mahboob K., Javed A.R., Rizwan M., Gadekallu T.R., Abidi M.H., Alkahtani M., Classification and categorization of covid-19 outbreak in pakistan, Computers, Materials and Continua, 69, 1, pp. 1253-1269, (2021); Issa T., Al Jaafari M., Alqahtani A.S., Alqahtani S., Issa T., Maketo L., Pervaiz S., Benefits and challenges of social networking during covid-19: Personal perspective, International Journal of Web Based Communities, 17, 2, pp. 135-148, (2021); Iwendi C., Mahboob K., Khalid Z., Javed A.R., Rizwan M., Ghosh U., Classification of covid-19 individuals using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, Multimedia Systems, 1-15, (2021); Jalil Z., Abbasi A., Javed A.R., Khan M.B., Hasanat M.H.A., Malik K.M., Saudagar A.K.J., Covid-19 related sentiment analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques, Frontiers in Public Health, 9, (2022); Ebibi M., Fetaji M., Use of Social Networking Tools in Online Education during the Pandemic from covid19, (2021); Shabbir A., Shabbir M., Javed A.R., Rizwan M., Iwendi C., Chakraborty C., Exploratory data analysis, classification, comparative analysis, case severity detection, and internet of things in covid-19 telemonitoring for smart hospitals, Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 1, (2022); Saleem K., Saleem M., Zeeshan R., Javed A.R., Alazab M., Gadekallu T.R., Suleman A., Situation-Aware Bdi Reasoning to Detect Early Symptoms of Covid 19 Using Smartwatch, IEEE Sensors Journal, 1, (2022); Gleiss A., Kohlhagen M., Pousttchi K., An apple a day-how the platform economy impacts value creation in the healthcare market, Electronic Markets, 31, 4, pp. 849-876, (2021); Rizwan M., Shabbir A., Javed A.R., Srivastava G., Gadekallu T.R., Shabir M., Hassan M.A., Risk monitoring strategy for confidentiality of healthcare information, Computers & Electrical Engineering, 100107833, (2022); Mehta P., Pandya S., Kotecha K., Harvesting social media sentiment analysis to enhance stock market prediction using deep learning, PeerJ Computer Science, 7476, (2021); Cavus N., Sani A.S., Haruna Y., Lawan A.A., Efficacy of social networking sites for sustainable education in the era of covid-19: A systematic review, Sustainability, 13, 2, (2021); Simon J., Helter T.M., White R.G., Van Der Boor C., Laszewska A., Impacts of the covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support: An austrian survey study, BMC Public Health, 21, 1, pp. 1-12, (2021); Shah K., Kamrai D., Mekala H., Mann B., Desai K., Patel R.S., Focus on mental health during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic: Applying learnings from the past outbreaks, Cureus, 12, 3, (2020); Javed A.R., Fahad L.G., Farhan A.A., Abbas S., Srivastava G., Parizi R.M., Khan M.S., Automated cognitive health assessment in smart homes using machine learning, Sustainable Cities and Society, 65102572, (2021); Javed A.R., Sarwar M.U., Beg M.O., Asim M., Baker T., Tawfik H., A collaborative healthcare framework for shared healthcare plan with ambient intelligence, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 10, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Rossi R., Socci V., Talevi D., Mensi S., Niolu C., Pacitti F., Di Marco A., Rossi A., Siracusano A., Di Lorenzo G., Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown measures impact on mental health among the general population in italy, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 11, (2020); Nawghare R., Tripathi S., Vardhan M., A survey on social networking using concept of evolutionary algorithms and big data analysis, Advances in Computational Intelligence and Communication Technology, pp. 277-292, (2021); Michinov E., Michinov N., Stay at home!

Build upon the previous studies, we extend the seminal theory of reasoned action (TRA) in this research, through the adoption of an salient but understudied construct, user role, which captures user inclination toward providing or seeking social support, and further explore how it impacts OHC users’ self-disclosure intention. We adopt a mixed methods approach including manual coding, machine learning algorithms, and econometric analyses, and investigate over 4 million posts over 17 years from a well-developed breast cancer OHC to uncover both direct and indirect effects of user role on OHC users’ intention of future self-disclosure intention. The results reveal both the main and moderating effects of user roles regarding users’ self-disclosure intention. First, user with a more clear intention of social support seeking or providing are more likely to disclose personal information. Second, the relative tendency of support provision magnifies the positive effects of attitudinal and normative factors toward future disclosure. We also discuss the findings and implications of the extended TRA framework to generate some actionable insights of OHC design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Online health communities; Self-disclosure; Social support exchange; Theory of reasoned action (TRA),,,,,,"City University of Hong Kong, (7200645); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72104261, 72201221); Central University of Finance and Economics, CUFE",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72104261 and Grant 72201221; Central University of Finance and Economics under the Program for Innovation Research; City University of Hong Kong under Faculty Start-Up Grant 7200645. ,"Oh S., Syn S.Y., Motivations for sharing information and social support in social media: a comparative analysis of Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, You tube, and Flickr, J Assoc Inf Sci Technol, 66, 10, pp. 2045-2060, (2015); Fox S., The Social Life of Health Information, (2014); Rideout V., Fox S., Digital health practices, social media use, and mental well-being among teens and young adults in the U.S, A National Survey Sponsored by Hopelab and Well Being Trust, (2018); Liu Q.B., Liu X., Guo X., The effects of participating in a physician-driven online health community in managing chronic disease: evidence from two natural experiments, MIS Q, 44, 1, pp. 391-419, (2020); Wang L., Yan L., Zhou T., Guo X., Heim G.R., Understanding physicians’ online-offline behavior dynamics: an empirical study, Inf Syst Res, 31, 2, pp. 537-555, (2020); Huang K.Y., Chengalur-Smith I., Pinsonneault A., Sharing is caring: social support provision and companionship activities in healthcare virtual support communities, MIS Q, 43, 2, pp. 395-424, (2019); Acquisti A., Brandimarte L., Loewenstein G., Privacy and human behavior in the age of information, Science, 347, 6221, pp. 509-514, (2015); Bol N., Dienlin T., Kruikemeier S., Sax M., Boerman S.C., Strycharz J., Helberger N., de Vreese C.H., Understanding the effects of personalization as a privacy calculus: analyzing self-disclosure across health, news, and commerce contexts †, J Comput Mediat Commun, 23, 6, pp. 370-388, (2018); Cavusoglu H., Phan T.Q., Cavusoglu H., Airoldi E.M., Assessing the impact of granular privacy controls on content sharing and disclosure on Facebook, Inf Syst Res, 27, 4, pp. 848-879, (2016); Barak A., Boniel-Nissim M., Suler J., Fostering empowerment in online support groups, Comput Hum Behav, 24, 5, pp. 1867-1883, (2008); Lieberman M., The role of insightful disclosure in outcomes for women in peer-directed breast cancer groups: a replication study, Psycho-Oncology, 16, 10, (2007); Wang X., Zhao K., Street N., Analyzing and predicting user participations in online health communities: a social support perspective, J Med Internet Res, 19, 4, (2017); Wang Y.-C., Kraut R., Levine J.M., To stay or leave?

The book conceptualizes the types of violence, abuse, neglect, and/or trauma that factor into ACEs. It also explores the psychopathological outcomes of ACEs among children, including neurodevelopmental and psychosocial mechanisms. By drawing on cross-cultural perspectives, the authors provide insight into the variations between the adversity and trauma children experience. Sections also cover preventive measures, risk factors and various forms of interventional treatment, making this book a core read for psychologists, physicians, social workers, educators and researchers in the field. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, the absence of programming libraries for sentimental analysis and a benchmark corpus has impeded advancements in this field. Challenges persist in working with diverse scripts of Kashmiri, including Perso-Arabic, Sharada, Devanagari, and Roman. Detecting cybercrime in this language is challenging due to its complex morphological nature, lack of resources, scarcity of annotated datasets, and varied linguistic characteristics, emphasizing the importance of overcoming these obstacles to develop effective detection systems. This paper attempts to detect content-based cybercrime in Roman Kashmiri script, extensively utilized on online platforms like social media, chat rooms, emails, etc., by the Kashmiri community. A well-balanced and meaningful dataset, the first of its kind in this context, is compiled, incorporating positive and negative comments, and three strategies were employed for analysis. The findings reveal that the Tf-Idf Vectorizer outperforms other tokenization methods (Count Vectorizer and Tf-Idf Transformer), bi-gram notation exhibits superior performance compared to one and tri-gram notations, and the XGBM proves to be the most effective in terms of evaluation metrics. Leveraging these strategies, Python applications were developed for text classification, successfully distinguishing cyberbullying (unsafe) from non-cyberbullying (safe) instances, with the XGBM exhibiting exceptional accuracy using the Tf-Idf Vectorizer with bi-gram, a Bag of Words, and lexical features. This pioneering research underscores the urgent need for content-based cybercrime detection advancements in the Kashmiri language, paving the way for effective detection systems to address language-specific challenges and promote a safer online environment for the Kashmiri community. Furthermore, this research opens new avenues for further advancements in detecting and preventing cybercrime in Kashmiri and potentially in other languages lacking robust cybercrime detection methodologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Cyberbullying; Ensemble learning; Kashmiri language; Koshur; Lexical features; LGBM; n-gram; XGBM,Computational linguistics; Computer crime; Online systems; Python; Social networking (online); Text processing; Content-based; Cyber bullying; Cyber-crimes; Ensemble learning; Kashmiri language; Koshur; Lexical features; LGBM; N-grams; XGBM; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"(2021); Parey F.H., KashmiriLanguage: multi-linguistic approach, issues and role of media in its accomplishments, Int J Sci Res Publ, 7, 6, pp. 228-235, (2017); Census OF India 2011, Language India, States and Union Territories, (2011); Kanth I., The untold story of the people of Azad Kashmir, Politics Relig Ideol, 14, 4, pp. 589-591, (2013); Shakil M., Languages of Erstwhile State of Jammu Kashmir (A Preliminary Study), (2012); Kiani K., (2018); Language and politics in Jammu and Kashmir: Issues and perspectives, Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh: Linguistic Predicament, (2021); Khatana D.R., Gujari Language and Identity in Jammu and Kashmir.

Particularly, the emphasis is placed on the official sites of public institutions on Facebook, such as kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and all institutions dealing with children. One of the source key issues is the ability to track these public pages by malicious visitors. The main point is the developed algorithm that analyzes any photo, recognizes kid(s), and blurs it during the upload photo onto the page of the social network.

This study aims to understand online sex offenders’ behaviors by modeling the factors associated with their use of technological data protection and anonymity preservation strategies. The data is based on a sample of 199 men involved in crimes related to the use of child pornography or sexual solicitation of minors online. The analytical strategy based on the use of an artificial neural network (ANN), a machine-learning system, identified two trends. First, those who displayed problematic substance use and sexual thoughts and fantasies as well as behaviors reported to be preoccupying did not use specific strategies to avoid police detection. Second, two combinations of factors predict use of police anti-detection strategy, suggesting that the criminal expertise of online sex offenders is manifested in two different patterns: those building on existing knowledge, and those learning skills through previous judicial experience. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,article; artificial neural network; child; child pornography; crime; data protection; fantasy; human; human experiment; human tissue; learning; machine learning; major clinical study; male; offender; police; sexual crime; skill; substance use,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (430-2019-0734)",This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2019-0734].,"Abu-Mostafa Y.S., Hints and the VC Dimension, Neural Computation, 5, 2, pp. 278-288, (1993); Alwosheel A., van Cranenburgh S., Chorus C.G., Is Your Dataset Big Enough?

Germany’s current artificial intelligence (AI) threats emanate from a range of challenges, including Germany’s growing international ambitions against a background of distinct sociopolitical crisis, social inequality, the risk of political radicalization, an increase in the number and quality of cybercrimes and others. This complex of intermingled challenges makes Germany extremely vulnerable to MUAI at all levels but especially in the area of psychological operations, where the rise of populism and new extremist movements increase the relevance of agenda-setting manipulations in social media and searching systems. Meanwhile, international tensions provide incentive for direct disinformation and defamation campaigns. This situation leads to scenarios where strong regulations based on AI ethics restrict the use of technologies by malicious actors, but also leads to the public perceiving those norms as excessively harsh, raising skepticism around AI in Germany. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Deepfakes; Extremist movements; Germany; Malicious use of artificial intelligence; Psychological security; Rising power; Social media,,,,,,,,"Anheier H., Germany's homegrown Q menace, (2021); Armiento I., A German Startup has a different approach to self-driving cars, (2022); Baierl R., Nitzsche B., Künstliche Intelligenz im deutschen Mittelstand-Empfehlungen für eine erfolgreiche Implementierung, Künstliche Intelligenz im Dienstleistungsmanagement, pp. 314-329, (2021); Bazarkina D., Pashentsev E., Malicious use of artificial intelligence, Russia in Global Affairs, 18, pp. 154-177, (2020); Germany starts enforcing hate speech law, (2018); Boettcher B., Schneider S., Polarisation in Germany-Fuelled but not caused by the corona crisis, pp. 1-15, (2020); Reichsbürger. and ""Selbstverwalter.""

In this paper, we report results from a study aimed at identifying sensitive content in photos from a human-centered perspective. We collected sensitive photos and/or descriptions of sensitive photos from participants and asked them to identify which elements of the photo made each photo sensitive. Using this information, we propose an initial two-level taxonomy of sensitive content categories. This taxonomy may be useful to privacy researchers, online social network designers, policy makers, computer vision researchers and anyone wishing to identify potentially sensitive content in photos. We conclude by providing insights about how these results may be used to enhance computer vision approaches to protecting image privacy. © 2018 IEEE.",,Computer privacy; Computer vision; Social networking (online); Taxonomies; Human perception; On-line social networks; Policy makers; Image enhancement,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1527421); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no.1527421.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no.1527421.

As a result, authorship analysis of anonymous texts in Internet (such as emails, forum comments) has attracted significant attention in the digital forensic and text mining communities. The main problem is a large number of possible of authors, which hinders the effective identification of a true author. We interpret open class author attribution as a process of expert recommendation where the decision support system returns a list of suspected authors for further analysis by forensics experts rather than a single prediction result, thus reducing the scale of the problem. We describe the task formally and present algorithms for constructing the suspected author list. For evaluation we propose using a simple Winner-Takes-All (WTA) metric as well as a set of gain-discount model based metrics from the information retrieval domain (mean reciprocal rank, discounted cumulative gain and rank-biased precision). We also propose the List Precision (LP) metric as an extension of WTA for evaluating the usability of the suspected author list. For experiments, we use our own dataset of Internet comments in Lithuanian language and consider the use of language-specific (Lithuanian) lexical features together with general lexical features derived from English language. For classification we use one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results of experiments show that the usability of open class author attribution can be improved considerably by using a set of language-specific lexical features together with general lexical features, while the proposed method can be used to reduce the number of suspected authors thus alleviating the work of forensic linguists. © 2017 PTI.",,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Digital forensics; Information systems; Internet; Support vector machines; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Expert recommendations; Information retrieval domain; Internet comments; Mean reciprocal ranks; One-class classifier; One-class support vector machine; Taxonomies,,,,,"Programme EC DG Home Affairs ISEC; European Commission, EC","The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the project “Lithuanian Cybercrime Centre of Excellence for Training, Research & Education” (L3CE) project, Grant Agreement No. HOME/2013/ISEC/AG/INT/4000005176), financed by European Commission under the Programme EC DG Home Affairs ISEC (Prevention of and against crime 2007-2013).","Irons A., Lallie H.S., Digital forensics to intelligent forensics, Future Internet, 6, pp. 584-596, (2014); Chaski C.E., Author identification in the forensic setting, The Oxford Handbook of Forensic Linguistics, (2012); Iqbal F., Binsalleeh H., Fung B.C.M., Debbabi M., A unified data mining solution for authorship analysis in anonymous textual communications, Inf.

People keep numerous identities on various online social sites. User-related network data has distinctive information which shows user interests, behavioral patterns, and political views. By using these behaviors individually and collectively are of great help to recognize users across social networks. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) has been performed to distinguish 31 papers published during 2010–2018. The idea is to determine user identification categories that are used to classify users. Furthermore, to identify algorithms, models, methods, and tools that has been suggested since 2010 for user characterization. We have identified 10 algorithms, 19 models, 5 methods and 8 tools that have proposed for 5 user identification categories. Finally, we empirically evaluated that text mining techniques are promising approaches for the identification of users on online social networks. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Online social networks;

Unfortunately, not all of us are equally aware of the threats when we use online services. Naive users are generally less aware of security and privacy practices on the Internet and are susceptible to online predators. In this paper, we present a behavioral analysis of Internet users and their susceptibility to online malpractices. We have considered the dataset from the Global Internet User Survey for 10789 respondents to perform a security-oriented statistical analysis of correlated user behavior. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the statistical predictability of susceptible and not-so-susceptible identity theft victims based on their behavior and knowledge of security and privacy practices. We posit that such a study can be used to assess the vulnerability of Internet users and can hence be used to leverage institutional and personal safety on the Internet by promoting online security education, threat awareness, and guided Internet-safe behavior. © 2016 IEEE.",Behavioral Analysis;

Cyberbullism, incitement to self-harm practices, sexual predation are just some of the severe effects of massive online offensives. Moreover, attacks can be carried out against groups of victims and can degenerate in physical violence. In this work, we aim at containing and preventing the alarming diffusion of such hate campaigns. Using Facebook as a benchmark, we consider the textual content of comments appeared on a set of public Italian pages. We first propose a variety of hate categories to distinguish the kind of hate. Crawled comments are then annotated by up to five distinct human annotators, according to the defined taxonomy. Leveraging morpho-syntactical features, sentiment polarity and word embedding lexicons, we design and implement two classifiers for the Italian language, based on different learning algorithms: the first based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the second on a particular Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). We test these two learning algorithms in order to verify their classification performances on the task of hate speech recognition. The results show the effectiveness of the two classification approaches tested over the first manually annotated Italian Hate Speech Corpus of social media text.

It also traces pathways for knowledge-based choices to be made about directions for future long-term biological evolution and cultural development in view of adaptation to the expected, probable and possible future and the ecological sustainability of our planetary environment The authors discuss ethical challenges associated with the major biosocial sources of human variation: individual variation, inter-personal variation, inter-group variation, and inter-generational variation. This book approaches the long-term challenges of the human species in a holistic way. Researchers will find an extensive discussion of the key theoretical scientific aspects of the relationship between evolution and morality. Policy makers will find information that can help them better understand from where we are coming and inspire them to make choices and take actions in a longer-term perspective.

While users are able to access information and share knowledge with unprecedented ease and openness, danger also lurks in the dark. Social networks have the potential to draw unwanted and anomalous attention to their users. Through online social networks, the daily routines of an individual may be under constant surveillance of others. Such risks are closely associated with information leakage, and have posed serious privacy and safety concerns. This paper investigates such risks, which are typically captured by excessive, unprecedented and persistent gathering of personal information through the cyberspace. We focus on ways to mitigate such risks through formalizing the concepts of anomalous attention. This is a challenging question, as such behaviors are usually victim-defined and often occurs without visible trace. Viewing a network as interconnected nodes who exchange information through posting and reading messages, we provide an abstract model of attention, and quantify the level of attention a user pays towards another. Analyzing the sequence of attention between pairs of users in the network allow one to capture anomalous activities. © 2017 IEEE.",,Information dissemination; User profile; Virtual reality; Abstract modeling; Cyberspaces; Daily routines; Information leakage; Interconnected nodes; Models of attention; Personal information; Privacy concerns; Safety concerns; Share knowledge; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Liu J., Moskvina A., Hierarchies, ties and power in organizational networks: Model and analysis, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 6, 1, (2016); Moskvina A., Liu J., How to Build Your Network? a Structural Analysis, (2016); Togetherness: An algorithmic approach to network integration, Ieee/acm International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, pp. 223-230, (2016); Integrating networks of equipotent nodes, International Conference on Computational Social Networks, pp. 39-50, (2016); Yan B., Chen Y., Liu J., Dynamic Relationship Building: Exploitation Versus Exploration on a Social Network, pp. 75-90, (2017); Joinson A., Looking at', 'looking up' or 'keeping up with' people?

Yet, there is currently no BEA-driven process model and guidelines for DF investigators to follow in order to take advantage of such an approach. This paper proposes the Behavioural Digital Forensics Model to fill this gap. It takes a multidisciplinary approach which incorporates BEA into in-lab investigation of seized devices related to interpersonal cases (i.e., digital crimes involving human interactions between offender(s) and victim(s)). The model was designed based on the application of traditional BEA phases to 35 real cases, and evaluated using 5 real digital crime cases - all from Dubai Police archive. This paper, however, provides details of only one case from this evaluation pool. Compared to the outcome of these cases using a traditional DF investigation process, the new model showed a number of benefits. It allowed a more effective focusing of the investigation, and provided logical directions for identifying the location of further relevant evidence. It also enabled a better understanding and interpretation of victim/offender behaviours (e.g., probable offenders’ motivations and modus operandi), which facilitated a more in depth understanding of the dynamics of the specific crime. Finally, in some cases, it enabled the identification of suspect's collaborators, something which was not identified via the traditional investigative process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Behavioural digital forensics model; Behavioural Evidence Analysis; Digital evidence interpretation; Digital forensics investigation; Reconstruction of digital crime,Computer crime; Crime; Digital devices; Electronic crime countermeasures; Mobile telecommunication systems; Digital crime; Digital evidence; Evidence analysis; Forensics investigations; Human interactions; In-depth understanding; Investigation process; Multi-disciplinary approach; Digital forensics,,,,,,,"Ademu I., Imafidon C., Preston D., A new approach of digital forensic model for digital forensic investigation, Int.

Cyberbullying, which is a kind of cybercrime, is defined as an aggressive, intentional action against a defenseless person by using the Internet, social media, or other electronic contents. Researchers have found that many of the bullying cases have tragically ended in suicides; hence automatic detection of cyberbullying has become important. The aim of this study is to detect cyberbullying on social media messages written in Turkish. To our knowledge, this is the first study which makes cyberbully detection on Turkish texts. We prepare a dataset from Instagram and Twitter messages written in Turkish and then we applied machine learning techniques that are Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision tree (C4.5), Naïve Bayes Multinomial, and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers to detect cyberbullying. We also apply information gain and chi-square feature selection methods to improve the accuracy of classifiers. We observe that when both words and emoticons in the text messages are taken into account as features, cyberbully detection improves. Among the classifiers, Naïve Bayes Multinomial is the most successful one in terms both classification accuracy and running time. When feature selection is applied classification accuracy improves up to 84% for the dataset used. © 2017 IEEE.",Cyberbullying; Social media; Text classification; Turkish texts,Classification (of information);

Many malicious websites can still escape detection with various Web spam techniques. In this paper, we first summarize three types of Web spam techniques used by malicious websites, such as redirection spam, hidden IFrame spam, and content hiding spam. We then present a new detection method that adopts the perspective of users and takes screenshots of malicious webpages to invalidate Web spams. The proposed detection method uses a Convolutional Neural Network, which is a class of deep neural networks, as a classification algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, two different experiments have been conducted. First, the proposed method was tested based on a constructed complex dataset. We present comparison results between the proposed method and representative machine learning-based detection algorithms. Second, the proposed method was tested to detect malicious websites in a real-world Web environment for three months. These experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has a better performance and is applicable to a practical Web environment. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network; Machine learning; Malicious website detection,Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Machine learning; Classification algorithm; Comparison result; Detection algorithm; Detection methods; Real world web; Screenshots; Web environment; Web spam; Websites,,,,,"Information Technology Research Center; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation, (IITP-2020-2015-0-00403); Ministry of Science and ICT","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) under Grant IITP-2020-2015-0-00403.","Ranjan A., The Battle against Malicious Websites, (2019); Dombrowski S.C., Gischlar K.L., Durst T., Safeguarding young people from cyber pornography and cyber sexual predation: A major dilemma of the Internet, Child Abuse Rev., J.

Users all over the world write, share, and publish personal information about themselves, their friends, and their workplaces within this platform of communication. In this study we demonstrate the relative ease of creating malicious socialbots that act as social network friends, resulting in OSN users unknowingly exposing potentially harmful information about themselves and their places of employment. We present an algorithm for infiltrating specific OSN users who are employees of targeted organizations, using the topologies of organizational social networks and utilizing socialbots to gain access to these networks. We focus on two well-known OSNs - Facebook and Xing - to evaluate our suggested method for infiltrating key-role employees in targeted organizations. The results obtained demonstrate how adversaries can infiltrate social networks to gain access to valuable, private information regarding employees and their organizations. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this work, we explored research pertaining to cyberbullying, conducted across disciplines. We mainly sought to understand scholarly activity on intelligence techniques for the detection of cyberbullying when it occurs. Our findings suggest that the vast majority of academic contributions on cyberbullying focus on understanding the phenomenon, risk factors, and threats, with the prospect of suggesting possible protection strategies. There is less work on intelligence techniques for the detection of cyberbullying when it occurs, while currently deployed algorithms seem to detect the problem only up to some degree of success. The article summarises the current trends aiming to encourage discussion and research with a new scope; we call for more research tackling the problem by leveraging statistical models and computational mechanisms geared to detect, intervene, and prevent cyberbullying. Coupling intelligence techniques with specific web technology problems can help combat this social menace.

These systems allow users to share personal data with their friends and thus rightfully desire to have enriched social interactions. Current access control models fulfill basic requirements of individual users but struggle to meet needs of social interactions such as multiparty privacy, politeness and asymmetric, non-reciprocal and intransitive nature of relationships. A personalized access control model, based on the social relations model and the socio-technical design paradigm, is proposed in this paper to satisfy these requirements. The model is formulated through extreme formal modeling and implemented through Facebook APIs. The model's expressiveness is examined for overlapping policies of multiple users, its consistency is analyzed for conflicting and redundant policies and user acceptance testing is performed for validity. The results suggest that the proposed technique outperformed the existing one to secure data in multiparty interactions. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

To better predict system vulnerabilities, cybersecurity researchers are developing new and more holistic approaches to characterizing cybersecurity system risk. The process must include characterizing the human factors that contribute to cyber security vulnerabilities and risk. Rationality, expertise, and maliciousness are key human characteristics influencing cyber risk within this context, yet maliciousness is poorly characterized in the literature. There is a clear absence of literature pertaining to human factor maliciousness as it relates to cybersecurity and only limited literature relating to aspects of maliciousness in other disciplinary literatures, such as psychology, sociology, and law. In an attempt to characterize human factors as a contribution to cybersecurity risk, the Cybersecurity Collaborative Research Alliance (CSec-CRA) has developed a Human Factors risk framework. This framework identifies the characteristics of an attacker, user, or defender, all of whom may be adding to or mitigating against cyber risk. The maliciousness literature and the proposed maliciousness assessment metrics are discussed within the context of the Human Factors Framework and Ontology. Maliciousness is defined as the intent to harm. Most maliciousness cyber research to date has focused on detecting malicious software but fails to analyze an individual's intent to do harm to others by deploying malware or performing malicious attacks. Recent efforts to identify malicious human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity, include analyzing motives driving insider threats as well as user profiling analyses. However, cyber-related maliciousness is neither well-studied nor is it well understood because individuals are not forced to expose their true selves to others while performing malicious attacks. Given the difficulty of interviewing malicious-behaving individuals and the potential untrustworthy nature of their responses, we aim to explore the maliciousness as a human factor through the observable behaviors and attributes of an individual from their actions and interactions with society and networks, but to do so we will need to develop a set of analyzable metrics. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to review human maliciousness-related literature in diverse disciplines (sociology, economics, law, psychology, philosophy, informatics, terrorism, and cybersecurity); and (2) to identify an initial set of proposed assessment metrics and instruments that might be culled from in a future effort to characterize human maliciousness within the cyber realm. The future goal is to integrate these assessment metrics into holistic cybersecurity risk analyses to determine the risk an individual poses to themselves as well as other networks, systems, and/or users. © 2018 King, Henshel, Flora, Cains, Hoffman and Sample.",Cyber security; Cyber terrorism; Human risk factors; Malicious intent; Metrics; Motivation; Rational behavior,,,,,,,,"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, (2017); Ajzen I., Nature and operation of attitudes, Annu.

It is also a powerful vector of innovation and, more than ever, a balance between economic and societal forces. That is why a large part of Strategic Intelligence for the Future 2 analyzes the various aspects of information, from traditional processing and research to the psychological and epigenetic aspects of its development. This leads to a new vision of its integration into organizations. In addition, new technologies offer extensive access to information, including social networks which are critically analyzed here. In a complex world where geopolitics and the new concept of information warfare are becoming increasingly important, it becomes imperative to better apprehend and understand our environment, in order to develop critical thinking that will reinforce the different global aspects of security in economic intelligence. © ISTE Ltd 2019.",,,,,,,,,"Berger S.L., Kouzarides T., Shiekhattar R., Et al., An operational definition of epigenetics, Genes & Development, 23, pp. 781-783, (2009); Bielecki A., The general entity of life: A cybernetic approach, Biological Cybernetics, 109, pp. 401-419, (2015); Bruner J.S., Hickmann M., La conscience, la parole et la ‘zone proximale’: Réflexions sur la théorie de Vygotski, Le développement de l’enfant.

When the image is sexually explicit and involves a child, the scale of this privacy violation grows tremendously worse and can have repercussions for the victim's whole life. Providing investigators with tools that can identify the perpetrators of child pornography (CP) trafficking is critical to addressing these violations. Investigators are interested in identifying these perpetrators on Freenet, which supports the anonymous publication and retrieval of data and is widely used for CP trafficking. We confirmed that 70, 000 manifests posted to public forums dedicated to child sexual abuse contained tens of thousands of known CP images including infants and toddlers. About 35% of traffic on Freenet was for these specific manifests. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel approach for investigating these privacy violations. In particular, our approach aims to distinguish whether a neighboring peer is the actual requester of a file or just forwarding the requests for other peers. Our method requires only a single peer that passively analyzes the traffic it is sent by a neighbor. We derive a Bayesian framework that models the observer's decision for whether the neighbor is the downloader, and we show why the sum traffic from downloaders relayed by the neighbor is not a significant source of false positives. We validate our model in simulation, finding near perfect results, and we validate our approach by applying it to real CP-related manifests and actual packet data from Freenet, for which we find a false positive rate of about 2%. Given these results, we argue that our method is an effective investigative method for addressing privacy violations resulting from CP published on Freenet. © 2017 Copyright held by the authors.",,Bayesian frameworks; Child pornographies; False positive; False positive rates; File sharing networks; Privacy violation; Public forums; Statistical detection,,,,,Brain Tumor Funders' Collaborative; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; llinois Institute of Technology,This work was supported in part by a Signature Interdisciplinary Research Area Grant from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

However, these digital natives were rather late starters since; their exposure to computers started when they could master the mouse and the penetration of computers in educational institutions was still very low. Today, a new breed of digital natives is emerging. This new breed includes those individuals who are being introduced from their first instances to the world of wireless devices. One year olds manage to master the intuitive touch interfaces of their tablets whilst sitting comfortably in their baby bouncers. The controller-less interfaces allow these children to interact with a machine in a way which was unconceivable below. Thus, our research investigated the paradigm shift between the different generations of digital natives. We analysed the way in which these two generations differ from each other and we explored how the world needs to change in order to harness the potential of these new digital natives. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,Digital natives; Educational institutions; Paradigm shifts; Touch interfaces; Wireless devices,,,,,,,"Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (Hid), (1996); The Next Generation of Aidc, (2003); (2012); (2013); Delhi Police, (2013); Adams P.C., Teaching and learning with simcity 2000, Journal of Geography, 97, 2, pp. 47-55, (1998); Allain J.S., From jeopardy! to jaundice: The medical liability implications of dr. watson and other artificial intelligence systems, La.

By drawing on data gathered with criminal justice practitioners, social workers, mothers of sons engaged in county lines and young people, this article draws on Colvin’s Differential Coercion Theory to argue that coercion in a county lines context is multifaceted; occurs on both interpersonal and impersonal levels and results in social-psychological deficits that create ‘spirals of coercion’. This article also considers divergences with Colvin’s theory which include ‘hyper-contexts’, the exertion of agency to acquire fast money and material gains and coercion online.
