People engage in education, business, shopping, and other social activities (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube). As social networking expands rapidly, its positive and negative impacts affect human health. All this leads to social crimes and illegal activities like phishing, hacking, ransomware, password attacks, spyware, blackmailing, Middle-man-attack. This research extensively discusses the social networking threats, challenges, online surveys, and future effects. We conduct an online survey using the google forms platform to collect the responses of social networking sites (SNS) users within Pakistan to show how SNS affects health positively and negatively. According to the collected response, we analyzed that 50% of the users use SNS for education purposes, 17.5% use it for shopping purposes, 58.2% use it for entertainment, 37.1% use it for communication, and 9.8% use it for other purposes. According to the response, the excessive use of SNS affects the health that 9.8% users face the physical threat, 42.8% user faces mental health issues due to excessive or inappropriate use of SN, and 50.5% users feel moral threat using Social sites. Finally, we conclude our paper by discussing the open challenges, conclusions, and future directions. © 2022 Rabia Abid et al.",,Computer viruses; Health; Health risks; Personal computing; Surveys; Facebook; Human health; Illegal activities; Networking security; Online surveys; Social activities; Social media networks; Social-networking; Systematic literature review; YouTube; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Abbasi A., Javed A.R., Chakraborty C., Nebhen J., Zehra W., Jalil Z., Elstream: An ensemble learning approach for concept drift detection in dynamic social big data stream learning, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 66408-66419, (2021); Sushama C., Kumar M.S., Neelima P., Privacy and Security Issues in the Future: A Social Media, Materials Today Proceedings, (2021); Gapinski C.M., Hermes J., Von Haaren C., Why people like or dislike large wood in rivers - A representative survey of the general public in Germany, River Research and Applications, 37, 2, pp. 187-197, (2021); Shaikh A.H., Meshram B.B., Security issues in cloud computing, Intelligent Computing and Networking, pp. 63-77, (2021); Ayoub A., Mahboob K., Javed A.R., Rizwan M., Gadekallu T.R., Abidi M.H., Alkahtani M., Classification and categorization of covid-19 outbreak in pakistan, Computers, Materials and Continua, 69, 1, pp. 1253-1269, (2021); Issa T., Al Jaafari M., Alqahtani A.S., Alqahtani S., Issa T., Maketo L., Pervaiz S., Benefits and challenges of social networking during covid-19: Personal perspective, International Journal of Web Based Communities, 17, 2, pp. 135-148, (2021); Iwendi C., Mahboob K., Khalid Z., Javed A.R., Rizwan M., Ghosh U., Classification of covid-19 individuals using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, Multimedia Systems, 1-15, (2021); Jalil Z., Abbasi A., Javed A.R., Khan M.B., Hasanat M.H.A., Malik K.M., Saudagar A.K.J., Covid-19 related sentiment analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques, Frontiers in Public Health, 9, (2022); Ebibi M., Fetaji M., Use of Social Networking Tools in Online Education during the Pandemic from covid19, (2021); Shabbir A., Shabbir M., Javed A.R., Rizwan M., Iwendi C., Chakraborty C., Exploratory data analysis, classification, comparative analysis, case severity detection, and internet of things in covid-19 telemonitoring for smart hospitals, Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 1, (2022); Saleem K., Saleem M., Zeeshan R., Javed A.R., Alazab M., Gadekallu T.R., Suleman A., Situation-Aware Bdi Reasoning to Detect Early Symptoms of Covid 19 Using Smartwatch, IEEE Sensors Journal, 1, (2022); Gleiss A., Kohlhagen M., Pousttchi K., An apple a day-how the platform economy impacts value creation in the healthcare market, Electronic Markets, 31, 4, pp. 849-876, (2021); Rizwan M., Shabbir A., Javed A.R., Srivastava G., Gadekallu T.R., Shabir M., Hassan M.A., Risk monitoring strategy for confidentiality of healthcare information, Computers & Electrical Engineering, 100107833, (2022); Mehta P., Pandya S., Kotecha K., Harvesting social media sentiment analysis to enhance stock market prediction using deep learning, PeerJ Computer Science, 7476, (2021); Cavus N., Sani A.S., Haruna Y., Lawan A.A., Efficacy of social networking sites for sustainable education in the era of covid-19: A systematic review, Sustainability, 13, 2, (2021); Simon J., Helter T.M., White R.G., Van Der Boor C., Laszewska A., Impacts of the covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support: An austrian survey study, BMC Public Health, 21, 1, pp. 1-12, (2021); Shah K., Kamrai D., Mekala H., Mann B., Desai K., Patel R.S., Focus on mental health during the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic: Applying learnings from the past outbreaks, Cureus, 12, 3, (2020); Javed A.R., Fahad L.G., Farhan A.A., Abbas S., Srivastava G., Parizi R.M., Khan M.S., Automated cognitive health assessment in smart homes using machine learning, Sustainable Cities and Society, 65102572, (2021); Javed A.R., Sarwar M.U., Beg M.O., Asim M., Baker T., Tawfik H., A collaborative healthcare framework for shared healthcare plan with ambient intelligence, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 10, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Rossi R., Socci V., Talevi D., Mensi S., Niolu C., Pacitti F., Di Marco A., Rossi A., Siracusano A., Di Lorenzo G., Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown measures impact on mental health among the general population in italy, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 11, (2020); Nawghare R., Tripathi S., Vardhan M., A survey on social networking using concept of evolutionary algorithms and big data analysis, Advances in Computational Intelligence and Communication Technology, pp. 277-292, (2021); Michinov E., Michinov N., Stay at home!

Yet, they are still struggling to incorporate basic social ideas for many different and new online activities. This has resulted in unintended exposure of users’ personal data and a rise in online threats as users have now become a desirable target for malicious activities. To address such challenges, various researchers have argued that STS should support user-oriented configurations to protect their users from online social abuse. Some methodologies have also been proposed to appreciate the integration of social values in the design of information systems, but they often lack an application mechanism. This paper presents a framework for the application of the socio-technical design methodology to incorporate social standards in the design of STS. The proposed framework exemplifies the socio-technical design approach by considering a list of social standards, followed by their mapping onto corresponding technical specifications. Based on these two sets, the framework highlights various individual, inter-group, and intra-group interactions and their supporting tools for STS governance. A conversation about the integration of social standards in STS is already materializing, therefore, a comprehensive framework to apply these standards in STS is entailed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Cyberspace; Online rights; Online standards; Rights management; Socio-technical design; System design,Online systems; Social networking (online); Cyberspaces; Design Methodology; Online activities; Online right; Online standard; Rights management; Social interactions; Social standards; Socio-technical designs; Sociotechnical systems; Design,,,,,,,"Ahmad A., Azhar A., Naqvi S., Nawaz A., Arshad S., Zeshan F., A methodology for sender-oriented anti-spamming, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 38, 3, pp. 2765-2776, (2019); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Janczewski L., Ali M., Chaudary M.H., Friedman R., A relation-aware multiparty access control, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems, 37, 1, pp. 227-239, (2019); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Distributed access control for social networks, International Conference of Information Assurance and Security, pp. 68-73, (2011); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Bertino E., Friedman R., Extending social networks with delegation, Computers & Security, 70, pp. 546-564, (2017); How Do App Stores Challenge the Global Internet Governance Ecosystem?, In IEEE Internet Computing (Vol, 20, 6, pp. 49-51, (2016); Baraniuk C., Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam, BBC News, 28Th April 2019., (2017); Beer D., Burrows R., Sociology and, of and in Web 2.0: Some Initial Considerations, Sociological Research Online, 12, 5, (2007); Beu D., Buckley M.R., The hypothesized relationship between accountability and ethical behavior, Journal of Business Ethics, 34, 1, pp. 57-74, (2001); Bird P., Accountability: Standards in financial reporting, (1973); Bonahoom O.M., Moral and ethical considerations in tax practice, Marquette Law Review, 37, 1, (1953); Bovens M., Goodin R.E., Schillemans T., The Oxford handbook public accountability, (2014); Brandom R., Is Facebook’s photo-tagging system violating privacy law?, The Verge, (2015); Broadbent J., Laughlin R., Control and legitimation in government accountability processes: The private finance initiative in the UK, Critical Perspectives on Accounting., 14, 1-2, pp. 23-48, (2003); Cahn A., Alfeld S., Barford P., Muthukrishnan S., An Empirical Study of Web Cookies, In Proceedings of the 25Th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW '16).

Current access control models fulfill basic requirements of individual users but struggle to meet needs of social interactions such as multiparty privacy, politeness and asymmetric, non-reciprocal and intransitive nature of relationships. A personalized access control model, based on the social relations model and the socio-technical design paradigm, is proposed in this paper to satisfy these requirements. The model is formulated through extreme formal modeling and implemented through Facebook APIs. The model's expressiveness is examined for overlapping policies of multiple users, its consistency is analyzed for conflicting and redundant policies and user acceptance testing is performed for validity. The results suggest that the proposed technique outperformed the existing one to secure data in multiparty interactions. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Yet, there is currently no BEA-driven process model and guidelines for DF investigators to follow in order to take advantage of such an approach. This paper proposes the Behavioural Digital Forensics Model to fill this gap. It takes a multidisciplinary approach which incorporates BEA into in-lab investigation of seized devices related to interpersonal cases (i.e., digital crimes involving human interactions between offender(s) and victim(s)). The model was designed based on the application of traditional BEA phases to 35 real cases, and evaluated using 5 real digital crime cases - all from Dubai Police archive. This paper, however, provides details of only one case from this evaluation pool. Compared to the outcome of these cases using a traditional DF investigation process, the new model showed a number of benefits. It allowed a more effective focusing of the investigation, and provided logical directions for identifying the location of further relevant evidence. It also enabled a better understanding and interpretation of victim/offender behaviours (e.g., probable offenders’ motivations and modus operandi), which facilitated a more in depth understanding of the dynamics of the specific crime. Finally, in some cases, it enabled the identification of suspect's collaborators, something which was not identified via the traditional investigative process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Behavioural digital forensics model; Behavioural Evidence Analysis; Digital evidence interpretation; Digital forensics investigation; Reconstruction of digital crime,Computer crime; Crime; Digital devices; Electronic crime countermeasures; Mobile telecommunication systems; Digital crime; Digital evidence; Evidence analysis; Forensics investigations; Human interactions; In-depth understanding; Investigation process; Multi-disciplinary approach; Digital forensics,,,,,,,"Ademu I., Imafidon C., Preston D., A new approach of digital forensic model for digital forensic investigation, Int.

This article investigates this phenomenon and shares an outline of how technology could develop further to counteract and mitigate the damage caused by online perpetrators. Cyber-stalking and online bullying can have devastating effects on individuals, but it's affecting the workplace too. In response, relevant technology could be used to counteract and mitigate the damage caused by online perpetrators. Haider M al-Khateeb and Gregory Epiphaniou of the University of Bedfordshire approach this issue using an incident response methodology and discuss the role of machine learning to identify and classify such attacks. They also examine how digital forensic investigations can be carried out in order to analyse the nature of the offence and preserve evidence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Attack vector; Devastating effects; Digital forensic; Incident response; Social life; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality,,,,,,,"Maple C., Short E., Brown A., Bryden C., Salter M., Cyberstalking in the UK: Analysis and Recommendations, International Journal of Distributed Systems and Technologies (IJDST), 3, 4, pp. 34-51, (2012); Short E., Linford S., Wheatcroft J.M., Maple C., The Impact of Cyberstalking: The Lived Experience-A Thematic Analysis, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 199, pp. 133-137, (2014); Gupta A., Kumaraguru P., Sureka A., 'Characterizing Pedophile Conversations on the Internet Using Online Grooming', (2012); Dinakar K., Reichart R., Lieberman H., 'Modeling the Detection of Textual Cyberbullying'. in the Social Mobile Web, (2011); Dadvar M., Trieschnigg D., De Jong F., Experts and Machines against Bullies: A Hybrid Approach to Detect Cyberbullies, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 275-281, (2014); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting Child Grooming Behaviour Patterns on Social Media, Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Fahrnberger G., Nayak D., Martha V.S., Ramaswamy S., SafeChat: A tool to shield children's communication from explicit messages, Innovations for Community Services (I4CS), 14th International Conference, (2014); Burmester M., Henry P., Kermes L.S., Tracking cyberstalkers: A cryptographic approach, ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society, 35, 3, (2005); Amuchi F., Al-Nemrat A., Alazab M., Layton R., Identifying cyber predators through forensic authorship analysis of chat logs, Cybercrime and Trustworthy Computing Workshop (CTC), (2012); Satta R., Stirparo P., Picture-to-identity linking of social network accounts based on sensor pattern noise, 5th International Conference on Imaging for Crime Detection and Prevention (ICDP 2013), (2013); Van Der Zwaan J., Dignum M., Jonker C., Simulating peer support for victims of cyberbullying'., BNAIC 2010: 22rd Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Luxembourg; Dinakar K., Jones B., Lieberman H., Picard R., Rose C., Thoman M., Reichart R.

A cyber-predator may interact with or gather confidential data about children without being physically present if IoT toys are hacked. Authentication to verify user identity is essential for all internet-connected applications, where relying on single authentication is not considered safe, especially in children's applications. Children often use easy-to-guess passwords in smart applications associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) for children's toys. In this paper, we propose to activate multi-factor authentication on the IoTs for children's toys connected to the internet using companion applications. When changing the user's behaviour (by IP address, GPS, OS version, and browser), the child's identity must be verified by two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to preserve the child's safety and privacy. This paper introduces multi-authentication mechanisms: a password and another authentication type, either mobile phone SMS, security token, digital certificate, or biometric authentication.  © 2022 IEEE.",authentication; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy; security; smart toys,Authentication; Behavioral research; Cybersecurity; Safety factor; Toys; Children's toys; Confidential data; Internet of thing; Multi-factor authentication; Privacy; Security; Security community; Smart applications; Smart toy; User identity; Internet of things,,,,,,,"Shah T., Venkatesan S., Authentications of IoT devices and IoT servers using secure vaults, Proc. 17th IEEE International Conferences on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications and 12th IEEE International Conferences on Big Data Sciences and Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE, pp. 819-824, (2018); Chu G., Apthorpe N., Feamster N., Security and privacy analysis of the IoT children's toys, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 1, pp. 978-985, (2019); Rivera D., Garcia A., Martin-Ruiz M.L., Alarcos B., Velasco J.R., Gomez Oliva A., Secure communication and protected data for an internet of things smart toy platforms, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 2, pp. 3785-3795, (2019); Shasha S., Mahmoud M., Mannan M., Youssef A., Playing with danger: A taxonomy and evaluations of threat to smart toy, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 2, pp. 2986-3002, (2018); Two-factor Authentication Provides Additional Security, (2017); Valente J., Cardenas A.A., Security and privacy in smart toys, Proceedings of Workshop on Internet of Things Security and Privacy, pp. 19-24, (2017); Haron G.R., Maniam D., Mat Nen L., Daud N.I., User behaviour and interactions for multimodal authentication, Proc. of 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST, pp. 309-316, (2016); Weaver A.C., Biometric authentication, Computer, 39, 2, pp. 96-97, (2006); Nobakht M., Sivaraman V., Boreli R., A host-based intrusions detection and mitigations frameworks for smart home IoTs using OpenFlow, Proc. of 11th International Conferences on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES, pp. 147-156, (2016); Bendiab G., Shiaeles S., Alruban A., Kolokotronis N., IoT malware network traffic classification using visual representations and deep learning, Proc.

Unfortunately, text length is limited on some platforms, making the challenge harder. We aim at identifying the authorship of Twitter messages limited to 140 characters. We evaluate popular stylometric features, widely used in literary analysis, and specific Twitter features like URLs, hashtags, replies or quotes. We use two databases with 93 and 3957 authors, respectively. We test varying sized author sets and varying amounts of training/test texts per author. Performance is further improved by feature combination via automatic selection. With a large amount of training Tweets (>500), a good accuracy (Rank-5>80%) is achievable with only a few dozens of test Tweets, even with several thousands of authors. With smaller sample sizes (10-20 training Tweets), the search space can be diminished by 9-15% while keeping a high chance that the correct author is retrieved among the candidates. In such cases, automatic attribution can provide significant time savings to experts in suspect search. For completeness, we report verification results. With few training/test Tweets, the EER is above 20-25%, which is reduced to <15% if hundreds of training Tweets are available. We also quantify the computational complexity and time permanence of the employed features.  © 2019 IEEE.",Authorship identification; biometrics; social media forensics; stylometry; writer identification; writer verification,Digital forensics; Automatic selection; Feature combination; Literary analysis; Microblogging; Search spaces; Stylometric features; Verification results; Writer identification; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Nirkhi S., Dharaskar R.V., Comparative study of authorship identification techniques for cyber forensics analysis, Int.

By drawing on data gathered with criminal justice practitioners, social workers, mothers of sons engaged in county lines and young people, this article draws on Colvin’s Differential Coercion Theory to argue that coercion in a county lines context is multifaceted; occurs on both interpersonal and impersonal levels and results in social-psychological deficits that create ‘spirals of coercion’. This article also considers divergences with Colvin’s theory which include ‘hyper-contexts’, the exertion of agency to acquire fast money and material gains and coercion online. The article concludes by reflecting on the implications for research, policy and practice. © The Author(s) 2023.",Agency; coercion; county lines; gangs; grooming; organised crime,,,,,,University of Westminster,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The University of Westminster ‘Research Communities Fund’.

Then, the constituent elements of SECC will be identified and explained in detail; later, possible prevention strategies and research areas will be discussed individually for each one. However, whether SECC should be defined as a separate criminal act and the legal conditions of punishment in the current criminal law systems are completely ignored. © 2016 International Journal of Cyber Criminology (IJCC).",Cyber crime; Online child sexual abuse; Policing; Raising awareness; Sextortion; Sexual extortion,,,,,,,,"Baker C.N., Sexual Extortion: Criminalizing Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Law & Ineq, 13, (1994); Briggs F., Hawkins R.M., Follow-up data on the effectiveness of New Zealand's national school based child protection program, Child abuse & neglect, 18, 8, pp. 635-643, (1994); Butler D., Kift S., Campbell M., Cyber bullying in schools and the law: Is there an effective means of addressing the power imbalance, eLaw J, 16, (2009); Butterfield L., NetSafe: the New Zealand model for Internet (ICT) safety education, (2002); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting Child Grooming Behaviour Patterns on Social Media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach, American sociological review, 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); Cole H., Griffiths M.D., Social interactions in massively multiplayer online role-playing gamers, CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10, 4, pp. 575-583, (2007); Davidson J.C., Martellozzo E., Educating children about sexual abuse and evaluating the Metropolitan Police Safer Surfing Programme, (2004); Davidson J., Martellozzo E., Lorenz M., Evaluation of CEOP ThinkUKnow internet safety programme and exploration of young people's internet safety knowledge, (2009); Dombrowski S.C., LeMasney J.W., Ahia C.E., Dickson S.A., Protecting Children From Online Sexual Predators: Technological, Psychoeducational, and Legal Considerations, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 35, 1, (2004); Edwards A., Judge calls child exploiter a 'narcissistic demon, ' hands down 30-year sentence, (2010); Ellison N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, 1, pp. 210-230, (2007); The Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) 2015, (2015); Goodno N., Cyberstalking, a new crime: Evaluating the effectiveness of current state and federal laws, Missouri Law Review, (2007); Haden S.C., Scarpa A., Jones R.T., Ollendick T.H., Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury: The moderating role of perceived social support and coping for young adults, Personality and Individual Differences, 42, 7, pp. 1187-1198, (2007); Hadnagy C., Social engineering: The art of human hacking, (2010); Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, (2016); Joyce M., Video Chat Extortion and Sexual Abuse, Korean Source, 122, pp. 20-32, (2012); Kerlikowske R.G., Wilson M., NetSmartz: a comprehensive approach to internet safety and awareness, Police Chief, 74, 4, (2007); Konrad K.A., Skaperdas S., Credible threats in extortion, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 33, 1, pp. 23-39, (1997); Kopecky K., Hejsek L., Kusa J., Maresova H., Rerichova V., Specifics of children communication and online aggressors within the online assaults on children (analysis of selected utterances), SGEM2015 Conference Proceedings, pp. 195-202, (2015); Kopecky K., Strucnỳ úvod do problematiky online vydírání ceskỳch detí se zamerením na tzv. sextortion, Pediatrie pro Praxi, 15, 6, pp. 352-354, (2014); Krone T., A typology of online child pornography offending, (2004); Leary M.G., Sexting or Self-Produced Child-Pornography-The Dialog Continues-Structured Prosecutorial Discretion within a Multidisciplinary Response, Va.

Our experimental results show that the method is feasible and more accurate than decision trees. © 2015 IEEE.",author identification; author verification; data mining; digital forensic; machine learning,Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computer crime; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Learning systems; Author identification; Classifier models; Decision-making rules; Digital forensic; Digital text; Domain knowledge; Metaheuristic; Swarm Intelligence; Electronic document identification systems,,,,,,,"Witten I.H., Frank E., Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, 2nd Ed, (2005); McEnery A., Oakes M., Authorship Studies/Textual Statistics, (2000); Li J., Zheng R., Chen H., From fingerprint to writeprint, Communications of the ACM, 49, 4, pp. 76-82, (2006); Koppel M., Schler J., Argamon S., Computational methods in authorship attribution, J. of the American Soc. for Information Science and Technology (JASIST), 60, 1, pp. 1-26, (2009); Khan S.R., Nirkhi S.M., Dharaskar R.V., Authorship identification for e-mail forensic, Proc.

Visual data can incriminate or exonerate; they can shape and reshape public opinion. Visual evidence can legitimize certain accounts of events while calling others into question. The proliferation of visual data creates challenges for the law at multiple points of entry: recording, distribution or disclosure, redaction or deletion, or use as evidence. This symposium outlines and analyzes legal challenges posed by recent developments in visual data technologies and practices. This introductory essay and the articles that follow highlight legal issues that arise when state actors collect visual data and when visual data are used in legal disputes. Technological development is outpacing empirical research on, and legal regulation of, visual data within society and inside the courtroom. This symposium provides a much-needed opportunity to highlight new legal and empirical research at the intersection of visual data and law. © 2018 American Bar Foundation.",,,,,,,"John D. and Catherine T.

It describes the CSAM ecosystem, focusing on the ways in which it is produced, distributed and consumed and explores different interventions that can be used to tackle each issue. Eliminating Online Child Sexual Abuse Material provides a methodical approach to unpacking and understanding this growing problem, identifies approaches that have been shown to work and offers alternatives that might be tried. This analysis is set within a crime science context that draws on rational choice, routine activities, situation crime prevention and environmental criminology to better understand the nature of the problem and the potential ways in which it may be solved. This book is intended for policymakers and practitioners working in child protection, online harms and related areas and for students studying sexual violence or internet-related crime. The book will also be of interest to crime scientists as it provides another example of how the approach can be used to understand and reduce crime. © 2023 Rick Brown.

However, current techniques still suffer from some limits that restrict their practical application, such as the use of errors as a key feature to train the lie detectors and the absence of normalized features. Here, an extension of a keystroke dynamics technique, which was recently proposed to detect faked identities, is reported with the goal to overcome these limitations. Using a Quadratic Discriminant Analysis an accuracy up to 92% in the identification of faked identities has been reached, even if errors were excluded from predictors and normalized features were included. The classification model performs similarly to those previously proposed, with a slightly lower accuracy (−3%) but overcoming their important practical limitations. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Identity verification; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detection,Discriminant analysis; Human engineering; Security of data; Behavioral measures; Classification models; Demographic information; Key feature; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detectors; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Dynamics,,,,,,,"Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, SocInfo 2014.

CSA can happen in several places, such as schools, households, hostels, and other public spaces. However, a large number of people, including parents, do not have an awareness of this sensitive issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used in various disciplines in the modern era. Hence, supervised machine learning models have been used to predict child sexual abuse awareness in this study. The dataset contains answers provided by 3002 people regarding CSA. A questionnaire dataset obtained though crowdsourcing has been used to predict a person’s knowledge level regarding sexual abuse in children. Heterogenous ML and deep learning models have been used to make accurate predictions. To demystify the decisions made by the models, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have also been utilized. XAI helps in making the models more interpretable, decipherable, and transparent. Four XAI techniques: Shapley additive values (SHAP), Eli5, QLattice, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), have been utilized to demystify the models. Among all the classifiers, the final stacked model obtained the best results with an accuracy of 94% for the test dataset. The excellent results demonstrated by the classifiers point to the use of artificial intelligence in preventing child sexual abuse by making people aware of it. The models can be used real time in facilities such as schools, hospitals, and other places to increase awareness among people regarding sexual abuse in children. © The Author(s) 2023.",Artificial intelligence; Child sexual abuse; Child sexual abuse awareness; Explainable artificial intelligence; Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME); Shapley additive values (SHAP); Supervised machine learning,,,,,,,,"Al-Shehari T., Alsowail R.A., An insider data leakage detection using one-hot encoding, synthetic minority oversampling and machine learning techniques, Entropy, 23, 10, (2021); Amrit C., Paauw T., Aly R., Lavric M., Identifying child abuse through text mining and machine learning, Expert Systems with Applications, 1, 88, pp. 402-418, (2017); Angelov P.P., Soares E.A., Jiang R., Arnold N.I., Atkinson P.M., Explainable artificial intelligence: An analytical review, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 11, 5, (2021); Arena S., Florian E., Zennaro I., Orru P.F., Sgarbossa F., A novel decision support system for managing predictive maintenance strategies based on machine learning approaches, Safety Science, 146, (2022); Assink M., van der Put C.E., Meeuwsen M.W., de Jong N.M., Oort F.J., Stams G.J., Hoeve M., Risk factors for child sexual abuse victimization: A meta-analytic review, Psychological Bulletin, 145, 5, (2019); Chadaga K., Prabhu S., Sampathila N., Chadaga R., Ks S., Sengupta S., Predicting cervical cancer biopsy results using demographic and epidemiological parameters: A custom stacked ensemble machine learning approach, Cogent Engineering, 9, 1, (2022); Christ C., De Waal M.M., Dekker J.J., van Kuijk I., Van Schaik D.J., Kikkert M.J., Goudriaan A.E., Beekman A.T., Messman-Moore T.L., Linking childhood emotional abuse and depressive symptoms: The role of emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems, PloS One, 14, 2, (2019); Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, .

This study aims to understand online sex offenders’ behaviors by modeling the factors associated with their use of technological data protection and anonymity preservation strategies. The data is based on a sample of 199 men involved in crimes related to the use of child pornography or sexual solicitation of minors online. The analytical strategy based on the use of an artificial neural network (ANN), a machine-learning system, identified two trends. First, those who displayed problematic substance use and sexual thoughts and fantasies as well as behaviors reported to be preoccupying did not use specific strategies to avoid police detection. Second, two combinations of factors predict use of police anti-detection strategy, suggesting that the criminal expertise of online sex offenders is manifested in two different patterns: those building on existing knowledge, and those learning skills through previous judicial experience. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,article; artificial neural network; child; child pornography; crime; data protection; fantasy; human; human experiment; human tissue; learning; machine learning; major clinical study; male; offender; police; sexual crime; skill; substance use,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (430-2019-0734)",This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2019-0734].,"Abu-Mostafa Y.S., Hints and the VC Dimension, Neural Computation, 5, 2, pp. 278-288, (1993); Alwosheel A., van Cranenburgh S., Chorus C.G., Is Your Dataset Big Enough?

It also traces pathways for knowledge-based choices to be made about directions for future long-term biological evolution and cultural development in view of adaptation to the expected, probable and possible future and the ecological sustainability of our planetary environment The authors discuss ethical challenges associated with the major biosocial sources of human variation: individual variation, inter-personal variation, inter-group variation, and inter-generational variation. This book approaches the long-term challenges of the human species in a holistic way. Researchers will find an extensive discussion of the key theoretical scientific aspects of the relationship between evolution and morality. Policy makers will find information that can help them better understand from where we are coming and inspire them to make choices and take actions in a longer-term perspective.

Clear focus on the ethical risks of this research is critical given that those risks are disproportionately born by already vulnerable populations. To understand and subsequently address these risks, we conducted a systematic literature review of computing research leveraging AI to combat human trafficking and apply a framework using principles from international human rights law to categorize ethical risks. This paper uncovers a number of ethical tensions including bias endemic in datasets, privacy risks stemming from data collection and reporting, and issues concerning potential misuse. We conclude by highlighting four suggestions for future research: broader use of participatory design; engaging with other forms of trafficking; developing best practices for harm prevention; and including transparent ethics disclosures in research. We find that there are significant gaps in what aspects of human trafficking researchers have focused on. Most research to date focuses on aiding criminal investigations in cases of sex trafficking, but more work is needed to support other anti-Trafficking activities like supporting survivors, adequately address labor trafficking, and support more diverse survivor populations including transgender and nonbinary individuals. © 2022 ACM.",artificial intelligence; ethics; human rights; human trafficking,Crime; Ethical technology; Social aspects; Best practices; Computing research; Data collection; Data reporting; Human rights; Human trafficking; Intelligence communities; Participatory design; Privacy risks; Systematic literature review; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental, the Philippines; United States of America: Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, (2000); Aizenberg E., Van Den Hoven J., Designing for Human Rights in AI.

Cyberbullism, incitement to self-harm practices, sexual predation are just some of the severe effects of massive online offensives. Moreover, attacks can be carried out against groups of victims and can degenerate in physical violence. In this work, we aim at containing and preventing the alarming diffusion of such hate campaigns. Using Facebook as a benchmark, we consider the textual content of comments appeared on a set of public Italian pages. We first propose a variety of hate categories to distinguish the kind of hate. Crawled comments are then annotated by up to five distinct human annotators, according to the defined taxonomy. Leveraging morpho-syntactical features, sentiment polarity and word embedding lexicons, we design and implement two classifiers for the Italian language, based on different learning algorithms: the first based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the second on a particular Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). We test these two learning algorithms in order to verify their classification performances on the task of hate speech recognition. The results show the effectiveness of the two classification approaches tested over the first manually annotated Italian Hate Speech Corpus of social media text.

However, these digital natives were rather late starters since; their exposure to computers started when they could master the mouse and the penetration of computers in educational institutions was still very low. Today, a new breed of digital natives is emerging. This new breed includes those individuals who are being introduced from their first instances to the world of wireless devices. One year olds manage to master the intuitive touch interfaces of their tablets whilst sitting comfortably in their baby bouncers. The controller-less interfaces allow these children to interact with a machine in a way which was unconceivable below. Thus, our research investigated the paradigm shift between the different generations of digital natives. We analysed the way in which these two generations differ from each other and we explored how the world needs to change in order to harness the potential of these new digital natives. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,Digital natives; Educational institutions; Paradigm shifts; Touch interfaces; Wireless devices,,,,,,,"Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (Hid), (1996); The Next Generation of Aidc, (2003); (2012); (2013); Delhi Police, (2013); Adams P.C., Teaching and learning with simcity 2000, Journal of Geography, 97, 2, pp. 47-55, (1998); Allain J.S., From jeopardy! to jaundice: The medical liability implications of dr. watson and other artificial intelligence systems, La.

It is of great need to be able to detect extreme criminal behaviours on the World-Wide Web and take measures to protect the general public from the effects of such behaviours. The aim of this chapter is to examine the current data analysis tools and technologies that are used to detect extreme online criminal behaviour and the challenges that exist associated with the use of these technologies. Specific emphasis is given to extreme criminal behaviours such as paedophilia and serial killing as these are considered the most dangerous behaviours. A number of conclusions are drawn in relation to the use and challenges of technological means in order to face such criminal behaviours. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,,,,,"Akerkar R., Big data computing, (2014); Almond L., McManus M.A., Chatterton H., Internet Facilitated Rape: A Multivariate Model of Offense Behavior, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, pp. 1-26, (2017); Rapist who used Facebook, Tinder and Snapchat to prey on 14 teenage girls is sentenced to 30 years in prison, (2018); Bleakley P., Watching the watchers: Taskforce Argos and the evidentiary issues involved with infiltrating Dark Web child exploitation networks, The Police Journal: Theory, Practice and Principles, pp. 1-16, (2018); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Information, Communication & Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Brewer J., Dealing With Psychopaths in the Internet Age, (2018); Broadhurst R., Grabosky P., Alazab M., Bouhours B., Chon S., An analysis of the nature of groups engaged in cyber crime, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 8, 1, pp. 1-20, (2014); Cano Basave A., Fern'andez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, SociInfo 2014: The 6th International Conference on Social Informatics, (2014); Chen F., Deng P., Wan J., Zhang D., Vasilakos A.V., Rong X., Data Mining for the Internet of Things: Literature Review and Challenges, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2015, (2015); Corriveau P., Greco C., Online Paedophilia and Cyberspace, (2018); Craker N., March E., The dark side of Facebook®: The Dark Tetrad, negative social potency, and trolling behaviours, Personality and Individual Differences, 102, pp. 79-84, (2016); Davies C., Sadistic' paedophile Matthew Falder jailed for 32 years, The Guardian, (2018); Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database Research Project, (2018); French L., Virtual Case Notes: Raped Through Internet - Swedish Man Convicted in Unprecedented Case, (2017); Galan-Garcia P., de la Puerta J.G., Gomez C.L., Santos I., Bringas P.G., Supervised Machine Learning for the Detection of Troll Profiles in Twitter Social Network: Application to a Real Case of Cyberbullying, International Joint Conference SOCO'13-CISIS'13-ICEUTE'13.

It is also a powerful vector of innovation and, more than ever, a balance between economic and societal forces. That is why a large part of Strategic Intelligence for the Future 2 analyzes the various aspects of information, from traditional processing and research to the psychological and epigenetic aspects of its development. This leads to a new vision of its integration into organizations. In addition, new technologies offer extensive access to information, including social networks which are critically analyzed here.

With manual inspections becoming increasingly infeasible, law enforcement bodies are optimising online investigations through data-mining technologies. Such technologies must be well designed and rigorously grounded, yet no survey of the online data-mining literature exists which examines their techniques, applications and rigour. This article remedies this gap through a systematic mapping study describing online data-mining literature which visibly targets law enforcement applications, using evidence-based practices in survey making to produce a replicable analysis which can be methodologically examined for deficiencies. © 2015 ACM.",Cybercrime; Law enforcement; Literature review; Online data mining; Opensource intelligence; OSINT; Systematic survey,Computer crime; Environmental regulations; Law enforcement; Surveys; Cybercrime; Literature reviews; Online data; Open-source; OSINT; Data mining,,,,,,,"Abbasi A., Affect intensity analysis of dark web forums, Intelligence and Security Informatics 2007 IEEE, pp. 282-288, (2007); Abbasi A., Chen H., Applying authorship analysis to extremist-group web forum messages, Intelligent Systems IEEE, pp. 67-75, (2005); Abbasi A., Chen H., Writeprints: A stylometric approach to identity-level identification and similarity detection in cyberspace, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 26, 2, (2008); Abbasi A., Chen H., Salem A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages: Feature selection for opinion classification in web forums, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 26, 3, (2008); (2013); Afroz S., Caliskan-Islam A., Stolerman A., Greenstadt R., McCoy D., Doppelg änger finder: Taking stylometry to the underground, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

While efforts to address the issue of sexual exploitation of children may be slow, the capabilities of offenders to organize, communicate over the internet, and harness technology are unequivocally fast. Protection of children against cyber exploitation has become imperative, and measures should be taken that are specific and targeted to provide specialized victim identification capabilities; adequate protection for children using the internet; genuine participation of children; a full and responsible private sector and finally, coordinated, effective, and structured international cooperation to protect all children. Combating the Exploitation of Children in Cyberspace: Emerging Research and Opportunities provides innovative research for understanding all elements of combating cyber exploitation of children including the roles of law enforcement, international organizations, and the judicial system and educating children and their families to the dangers of the independent internet usage through cyberspace awareness programs. The content within this publication examines child grooming, cyberbullying, and cybercrime. It is designed for law enforcement, lawmakers, teachers, government officials, policymakers, IT specialists, cybercriminal researchers, psychologists, victim advocates, professionals, academicians, researchers, and students. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Users all over the world write, share, and publish personal information about themselves, their friends, and their workplaces within this platform of communication. In this study we demonstrate the relative ease of creating malicious socialbots that act as social network friends, resulting in OSN users unknowingly exposing potentially harmful information about themselves and their places of employment. We present an algorithm for infiltrating specific OSN users who are employees of targeted organizations, using the topologies of organizational social networks and utilizing socialbots to gain access to these networks. We focus on two well-known OSNs - Facebook and Xing - to evaluate our suggested method for infiltrating key-role employees in targeted organizations. The results obtained demonstrate how adversaries can infiltrate social networks to gain access to valuable, private information regarding employees and their organizations. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Some social content violates the integrity and dignity of users, therefore, this task has become challenging. The need to deal with short texts, poorly written language, unbalanced classes, and non-thematic aspects. These can lead to overfitting in deep neural network (DNN) models used for classification tasks. Empirical evidence in previous studies indicates that some of these problems can be overcome by improving the optimization process of the DNN weights to avoid overfitting. Moreover, a well-defined learning process in the input examples could improve the order of the patterns learned throughout the optimization process. In this paper, we propose four Curriculum Learning strategies and a new Hybrid Genetic–Gradient Algorithm that proved to improve the performance of DNN models detecting the class of interest even in highly imbalanced datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Curriculum Learning; Deep neural networks; Genetic algorithm; Natural language processing; Optimization process; Text classification,Classification (of information); Curricula; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Curriculum learning; Evolutionary optimizations; Exponential growth; Language processing; Learning optimizations; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural network model; Overfitting; Text classification; Deep neural networks,,,,,"CIMAT Bajio Supercomputing Laboratory, (300832, BP-FP-20201015143044227-814705); Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas; Desarrollo de Inteligencia Artificial, (11989, 1311, 2020-01, 314967, 617); Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT; Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica, INAOE","Funding text 1: Some important parts of this work were supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas and Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica through project fund and Grants (declared in the Acknowledgments section). ; Funding text 2: The authors thank Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT), Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT) and Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE) for the computer resources provided through the INAOE Supercomputing Laboratory’s Deep Learning Platform for Language Technologies (Laboratorio de Supercómputo: Plataforma de Aprendizaje Profundo) with the project “Identification of Aggressive and Offensive text through specialized BERT’s ensembles” and CIMAT Bajio Supercomputing Laboratory (#300832).

However, it has not yet been settled what causes this variation, and several factors have been proposed in the literature, including internet habituation, individualism, and uncertainty avoidance. Here we investigate these factors by two studies. In the first, we examine the association between online privacy concerns and a new measure of online self-disclosure norms that we introduce. We find that this measure is significantly associated with two established instruments of online privacy concerns in the literature. In the second, we analyze previously unpublished data from a questionnaire on online self-disclosure norms as assessed by this new measure. It includes replies from 18,046 adult respondents from 57 countries and six continents. We find that norms in favor of more restrictive online self-disclosure are weaker in countries with higher levels of internet penetration (r = −0.56, p < .001). Our findings suggest that higher internet penetration in a country reduces online privacy concerns. The results support the idea that habituation to online environments decreases privacy risk perceptions. An implication is that preferences for online privacy are likely to decline over time in countries where internet penetration is still low. Lastly, in conflict with previous studies, our analyses do not support the theory that online privacy concerns are associated with national cultures related to individualism or uncertainty avoidance as measured by Hofstede's indices. © 2023 The Authors",Cultural variation; Hofstede; Individualism; Internet penetration; Privacy concerns; Self-disclosure norms; Uncertainty avoidance,,,,,,"Bernardo Manhique; Harry Manley; SwedishFoundation for Humanities and Social Sciences; WASP-HS; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ, (P17–0030:1); Marcus och Amalia Wallenbergs minnesfond, MAW","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program – Humanities and Society (WASP-HS) funded by the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation , and the SwedishFoundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) [grant no.

This paper examines this question in the light of the “language of nature” and of Aristotelian causal analysis, in particular the concept of means and ends. Thus, it is possible to point out the root of the distinction between the identity of the person and the entity of any technology. Nature indicates that the person is always an end in itself. Technology, on the contrary, should only be a means to serve the person. The diversity of their respective natures also explains why their respective agencies enjoy diverse scopes. Technological operations (artificial agency, artificial intelligence) find their meaning in the results obtained through them (poiesis). Moreover, the person is capable of actions whose purpose is precisely the action itself (praxis), in which personal agency and, ultimately, the person themselves, is irreplaceable. Forgetting the distinction between what, by nature, is an end and what can only be a means is equivalent to losing sight of the instrumental nature of AI and, therefore, its specific meaning: the greatest good of the patient. It is concluded that the language of nature serves as a filter that supports the effective subordination of the use of AI to its specific purpose, the human good. The greatest contribution of this work is to draw attention to the nature of the person and technology, and about their respective agencies. In other words: listening to the language of nature, and attending to the diverse nature of the person and technology, personal agency, and artificial agency. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; ethics; language of nature; patient care,artificial intelligence; health care; language; public health; Article; artificial intelligence; biodiversity; comprehension; decision making; decision support system; health care; health care personnel; health legislation; human; human rights; interpersonal communication; language; medical ethics; orientation; patient care; patient education; social subordination; technology,,,,,,,"Ageing and Health, (2022); Bajwa J., Munir U., Nori A., Williams B., Artificial intelligence in healthcare: Transforming the practice of medicine, Future Healthc.

Detecting these risks with as much anticipation as possible is crucial for prevention. However, much research so far has focused on forensic tools that can be applied only when an attack has been performed. This paper proposes a novel and effective methodology for the early detection of threats in written social media. The goal is to recognize a potential attack before it is consummated, and using a minimum amount of information. The proposed approach considers the use of profile-based representations (PBRs) for this goal. PBRs have multiple benefits, including non-sparsity, low dimensionality, and a proved discriminative power. Moreover, representations for partial documents can be derived naturally with PBRs, which makes them suitable for the addressed problem. Results include empirical evidence on the usefulness of PBRs in the early recognition setting for two tasks in which anticipation is critical: sexual predator detection and aggressive text identification. These results reveal, on the one hand, that PBRs achieve state of the art performance when using full-length documents (i.e., the classical task), and, on the other hand, that the proposed methodology outperforms previous work on early recognition of sexual predators by a considerable margin, while obtaining state of the art performance in aggressive text identification. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported on early recognition for the approached problems. We foresee this work will pave the way for the development of novel methodologies for the problem and will motivate further research from the intelligent systems and text mining communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Aggressive text identification; Deception detection; Profile-based representations; Sexual predator detection,Data mining; Intelligent systems; Amount of information; Deception detection; Detection of deceptions; Discriminative power; Low dimensionality; Profile-based representations; State-of-the-art performance; Text identification; Character recognition,,,,,"Red Temática CONACYT en Tecnologías del Lenguaje, (260178, 271622); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (CB-2014-241306, CB-2015-1-258588, PDCPN2014-01-247870); Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, UANL","This work was supported by CONACYT under project grants CB-2014-241306, PDCPN2014-01-247870 and CB-2015-1-258588.

Furthermore, the absence of programming libraries for sentimental analysis and a benchmark corpus has impeded advancements in this field. Challenges persist in working with diverse scripts of Kashmiri, including Perso-Arabic, Sharada, Devanagari, and Roman. Detecting cybercrime in this language is challenging due to its complex morphological nature, lack of resources, scarcity of annotated datasets, and varied linguistic characteristics, emphasizing the importance of overcoming these obstacles to develop effective detection systems. This paper attempts to detect content-based cybercrime in Roman Kashmiri script, extensively utilized on online platforms like social media, chat rooms, emails, etc., by the Kashmiri community. A well-balanced and meaningful dataset, the first of its kind in this context, is compiled, incorporating positive and negative comments, and three strategies were employed for analysis. The findings reveal that the Tf-Idf Vectorizer outperforms other tokenization methods (Count Vectorizer and Tf-Idf Transformer), bi-gram notation exhibits superior performance compared to one and tri-gram notations, and the XGBM proves to be the most effective in terms of evaluation metrics. Leveraging these strategies, Python applications were developed for text classification, successfully distinguishing cyberbullying (unsafe) from non-cyberbullying (safe) instances, with the XGBM exhibiting exceptional accuracy using the Tf-Idf Vectorizer with bi-gram, a Bag of Words, and lexical features. This pioneering research underscores the urgent need for content-based cybercrime detection advancements in the Kashmiri language, paving the way for effective detection systems to address language-specific challenges and promote a safer online environment for the Kashmiri community. Furthermore, this research opens new avenues for further advancements in detecting and preventing cybercrime in Kashmiri and potentially in other languages lacking robust cybercrime detection methodologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Cyberbullying; Ensemble learning; Kashmiri language; Koshur; Lexical features; LGBM; n-gram; XGBM,Computational linguistics; Computer crime; Online systems; Python; Social networking (online); Text processing; Content-based; Cyber bullying; Cyber-crimes; Ensemble learning; Kashmiri language; Koshur; Lexical features; LGBM; N-grams; XGBM; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"(2021); Parey F.H., KashmiriLanguage: multi-linguistic approach, issues and role of media in its accomplishments, Int J Sci Res Publ, 7, 6, pp. 228-235, (2017); Census OF India 2011, Language India, States and Union Territories, (2011); Kanth I., The untold story of the people of Azad Kashmir, Politics Relig Ideol, 14, 4, pp. 589-591, (2013); Shakil M., Languages of Erstwhile State of Jammu Kashmir (A Preliminary Study), (2012); Kiani K., (2018); Language and politics in Jammu and Kashmir: Issues and perspectives, Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh: Linguistic Predicament, (2021); Khatana D.R., Gujari Language and Identity in Jammu and Kashmir.

Applying an offender-based perspective which considers the central role of convenience, it seeks to inform, improve and develop the current literature on cybercrime, whilst paying particular attention to its founding category within criminology. It argues that white-collar crime has receded from criminological perspectives on cybercrime in recent years and that a detailed, rich re-assessment of white-collar crime in contemporary digital societies is needed. Following a theoretical introduction, the book develops to discuss, inter alia, implications for corporate reputation, the various organizational roles utilized in mitigating external and internal threats, the unique considerations involved in law enforcement efforts, and likely future directions within the field. White-Collar Crime Online recognises the strong lineage and correlation that exists between the study of white-collar crime and cybercrime. Using convenience theory within a comparative analysis which includes case-studies, the book explores both European and American paradigms, perspectives and models to determine where white-collar crime exists within the contemporary workplace and how this might relate to the ongoing discourse on cybercrime. In doing so it revaluates criminological theory within the context of changing patterns of business, the workplace, social rules, systems of governance, decision making, social ordering and control. White-Collar Crime Online will speak to criminologists, sociologists and professionals; including those interested in cyber-security, economics, technology and computer science. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2022.

The wider project examines online identity assumption in online paedophile activity and the policing of such activity, and involves dealing with the linguistic analysis of highly sensitive sexual grooming transcripts. Within the linguistics portion of the project, we examine theories of idiolect and identity through analysis of the 'talk' of perpetrators of online sexual abuse, and of the undercover officers that must assume alternative identities in order to investigate such crimes. The essential linguistic question in this article is methodological and concerns the applicability of experimental work to exploration of online identity and identity disguise. Although we touch on empirical questions, such as the sufficiency of linguistic description that will enable convincing identity disguise, we do not explore the experimental results in detail. In spite of the preference within a range of discourse analytical paradigms for 'naturally occurring' data, we argue that not only does the term prove conceptually problematic, but in certain contexts, and particularly in the applied forensic context described, a rejection of experimentally elicited data would limit the possible types and extent of analyses. Thus, it would restrict the contribution that academic linguistics can make in addressing a serious social problem. © 2016 Oxford University Press.",,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/L003279/1)",,"Al-Sadi R.A., Hamdan J.M., Synchronous online chat' English: Computer mediated communication, World Englishes, 24, 4, pp. 409-424, (2005);

The authors have drawn on their extensive experience in training undercover officers to develop innovative methods in identifying the creation and performance of online personas, crucial in detecting identity disguise online. This groundbreaking book demonstrates these methods through case studies, whilst also exploring the link between language and identity. By bringing together previously opposed positions in forensic authorship analysis, the book develops a novel theory of linguistic identity, which will resonate not just in forensic authorship research but in sociolinguistics more widely. This unique forensic linguistic project has real-life impact in assisting the police in their investigation of online abusers, and has impact for students and researchers of linguistics, through its contribution to the research of linguistic identities. © Tim Grant and Nicci MacLeod 2020.

Although reactive predator detection methods have been studied, proactive victim protection and crime prevention can also be achieved through vulnerability analysis of potential youth victims. Despite its significance, vulnerability analysis has not been thoroughly studied in the data science literature, while several social science studies used survey-based methods. To address this gap, we investigate humans' social-psychological traits and quantify key vulnerability factors to cybergrooming by analyzing text features in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Through pairwise correlation studies, we demonstrate the degrees of key vulnerability dimensions to cybergrooming from youths' conversational features. Our findings reveal that victims have negative correlations with family and community traits, contrasting with previous social survey studies that indicated family relationships or social support as key vulnerability factors. We discuss the current limitations of text mining analysis and suggest cross-validation methods to increase the validity of research findings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into understanding the vulnerability factors to cybergrooming and highlights the importance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",and vulnerability.; cybergrooming; Natural language processing; online social deception; social-psychological analysis; text mining,Cybersecurity; Data mining; Social networking (online); And vulnerability.; Cybergrooming; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online social deception; Psychological analysis; Social-psychological analyse; Text-mining; Vulnerability analysis; Natural language processing systems,,,,,"ISDA-ISERC; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, VT",This research is partly supported by Virginia Tech’s ISDA-ISERC (Integrated Security Destination Area-The Integrated Security Education and Research Center) Research Program.,"Muslah Albladi S., Weir G.Rs., Predicting individuals' vulnerability to social engineering in social networks, Cybersecurity, 3, 1, pp. 1-19, (2020); Anderson P., Zuo Z., Yang L., Qu Y., An Intelligent Online Grooming Detection System Using AI Technologies, 2019 Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), pp. 1-6, (2019); Badillo-Urquiola K., Shea Z., Agha Z., Lediaeva I., Wisniewski P., Conducting Risky Research with Teens: Co-Designing for the Ethical Treatment and Protection of Adolescents, Proc.

Although cybergrooming has been recognized as a cybercrime, there is a lack of programs to protect youth from cybergrooming. We present a generative chatbot framework, SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate fluent authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot. Furthermore, we propose deep-reinforcement-learning-based dialogue generation with a stage-related reward to lead the conversation to the expected stage. We also minimize potential ethical issues introduced by the perverted languages when deploying the chatbots for cybersecurity education programs.

The number of vulnerabilities exploited has also risen in tandem with the increased sales. The attack vectors have greatly increased due to the connectivity and mass functionality of these devices. The lack of security in smartwatches, marketed towards children, poses a prominent threat for their safety and security. Results reported in this paper revealed significant security vulnerabilities in several popular kids’ smartwatches when exploited by SMS command injection, Bluetooth tracking and Wi-Fi man in the middle attack. The devices investigated were kids’ smartwatches, a fitness tracker and a smart phone with varying functions, connections and security features. Findings of the paper raise concerns as vulnerabilities of kids’ IoT smart devices can lead to criminal cases, such as child grooming and child abduction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Child abduction; Child grooming; Cybercrime; Fitbit; IoT; Pentesting; Smartwatches,,,,,,,,"Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Makhdoom I., Abolhasan M., Lipman J., Liu R.P., Ni W., Anatomy of threats to the internet of things, IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 21, 2, pp. 1636-1675, (2018); Alladi T., Chamola V., Sikdar B., Choo K.K.R., Consumer IoT: Security vulnerability case studies and solutions, IEEE Consum Electron Mag, 9, 2, pp. 17-25, (2020); Liao B., Ali Y., Nazir S., He L., Khan H.U., Security analysis of IoT devices by using mobile computing: A systematic literature review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 120331-120350, (2020); Saatjohann C., Ising F., Krings L., Schinzel S., STALK: Security analysis of smartwatches for kids.

No aspect of life is left untouched and in the world of crime, especially grooming crimes, which target victims who are children, are also experiencing considerable increase. Legal limitations make it difficult for law enforcement officials to carry out more effective law enforcement. This study examines the legal regime and the factors that encourage crime against children. The present research will be an important point of departure as it will influence the work process of law enforcement officers in terms of child care, especially for child victims. This study uses a legal normative method with a qualitative case study approach, a conceptual approach and a legislative approach. The results show that legal arrangements regarding grooming crimes are regulated using different laws, but do not clearly and explicitly address the many important issues around grooming crimes. As a result, law enforcement officials have difficulty interpreting laws in relation to the relevant causal factors, such as the perpetrator, the victim and social factors. © (2023).

This book expands the lens of Cyberpsychology to consider how digital experiences play out across the various stages of people's lives. Most psychological research has focused on whether human-technology interactions are a 'good' or a 'bad' thing for humanity. This book offers a distinctive approach to the emergent area of Cyberpsychology, moving beyond these binary dilemmas and considering how popular technologies have come to frame human experience and relationships. In particular the authors explore the role of significant life stages in defining the evolving purpose of digital technologies. They discuss how people's symbiotic relationship with digital technologies has started to redefine our childhoods, how we experience ourselves, how we make friends, our experience of being alone, how we have sex and form romantic relationships, our capacity for being antisocial as well as the experience of growing older and dying. This interdisciplinary book will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners across psychology, digital technology and media studies as well as anyone interested in how technology influences our behaviour. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

It provides an authoritative synthesis of the disparate literature on the various types of cybercrime, the global investigation and detection of cybercrime and the role of digital information, and the wider role of technology as a facilitator for social relationships between deviants and criminals. It includes coverage of: Key theoretical and methodological perspectives; computer hacking and malicious software; digital piracy and intellectual theft; economic crime and online fraud; pornography and online sex crime; cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking; cyber-terrorism and extremism; digital forensic investigation and its legal context around the world; the law enforcement response to cybercrime transnationally; cybercrime policy and legislation across the globe. The new edition features two new chapters, the first looking at the law enforcement response to cybercrime and the second offering an extended discussion of online child pornography and sexual exploitation. This book includes lively and engaging features, such as discussion questions, boxed examples of unique events and key figures in offending, quotes from interviews with active offenders, and a full glossary of terms. This new edition includes QR codes throughout to connect directly with relevant websites. It is supplemented by a companion website that includes further exercises for students and instructor resources. This text is essential reading for courses on cybercrime, cyber-deviancy, digital forensics, cybercrime investigation, and the sociology of technology. © 2018 Thomas J. Holt, Adam M.

Moreover, the majority of experimental investigations have utilized self-reported questionnaires or irrelevant economic games to reflect people’s prosocial behavior instead of measuring prosocial behavior demonstrated in real-life, natural settings. Considering the gaps in past research, this systematic review aims to identify literature regarding the influence of social media on emerging adults’ prosocial behaviors. The review focuses on studies that observed individuals’ prosocial behavior in real-life settings to eliminate social desirability bias and accurately establish the effects of social media on emerging adults’ prosocial behavior. © 2024 The Author(s).

In this work, we explored research pertaining to cyberbullying, conducted across disciplines. We mainly sought to understand scholarly activity on intelligence techniques for the detection of cyberbullying when it occurs. Our findings suggest that the vast majority of academic contributions on cyberbullying focus on understanding the phenomenon, risk factors, and threats, with the prospect of suggesting possible protection strategies. There is less work on intelligence techniques for the detection of cyberbullying when it occurs, while currently deployed algorithms seem to detect the problem only up to some degree of success. The article summarises the current trends aiming to encourage discussion and research with a new scope; we call for more research tackling the problem by leveraging statistical models and computational mechanisms geared to detect, intervene, and prevent cyberbullying. Coupling intelligence techniques with specific web technology problems can help combat this social menace. We argue that a multidisciplinary approach is needed, with expertise from human–computer interaction, psychology, computer science, and sociology, for current challenges to be addressed and significant progress to be made. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",bullying; cyber aggression; Cyberbullying; internet bullying; literature survey; social media,Human computer interaction; Social networking (online); Social sciences; bullying; cyber aggression; Cyber bullying; Literature survey; Social media; article; bullying; human; human computer interaction; intelligence; Internet; psychology; risk factor; social media; sociology; Computer crime,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691025); European Commission, EC, (H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015–691025)",This work is partially funded by the EC project ‘ENCASE (ENhancing seCurity and privAcy in the Social wEb): a user-centred approach for the protection of minors’ under the contract H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015–691025.,"Al Mazari A., 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT), (2013); Baldry A.C., Farrington D.P., Sorrentino A., School Bullying and Cyberbullying among Boys and Girls: Roles and Overlap, Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma, 26, 9, pp. 937-951, (2017); Barlinska J., Szuster A., Winiewski M., Cyberbullying among Adolescent Bystanders: Role of the Communication Medium, Form of Violence, and Empathy, Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology, 23, 1, pp. 37-51, (2013); Blumenfeld W.J., Cooper R.M., LGBT and Allied Youth Responses to Cyberbullying: Policy Implications, The International Journal of Critical Pedagogy, 3, 1, (2010); Brack K., Caltabiano N., Cyberbullying and Self-esteem in Australian Adults, Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace, 8, 2, (2014); Corcoran L., Guckin C.M., Prentice G., Cyberbullying or Cyber Aggression?

In this day and age, traditional literacy proves inadequate and digital literacy has become a necessity within the education sector. The COVID-19 pandemic and the intensification of the industrial revolution mean that education has rapidly shifted online. It has, therefore, become important to understand the challenges faced in the move to online teaching and learning in Malaysia, especially in this post-pandemic era. This chapter discusses the concept of digital literacy, as well as various motivating factors for educators and learners to make the migration from traditional to online teaching and learning. These challenges include the lack of coherent policymaking both at the national and institute levels, the digital divide that exists, the readiness of teachers and students in making the transition, the concern for special needs education and, finally, security concerns involved. It concludes with an assessment of the prospects for digital literacy and online teaching and learning in Malaysia. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Rajah Rasiah, Wah Yun Low, and Nurliana Kamaruddin;

Due to the prevalence of the online conversations, mitigating the undesirable effects of child abuse in cyber space has become inevitable. Using automatic ways to combat this kind of crime is challenging and demands efficient and scalable data mining techniques. The problem can be casted as a combination of textual preprocessing in data/text mining and pattern classification in machine learning. This chapter covers different data mining methods including preprocessing, feature extraction and the popular ways of feature enrichment through extracting sentiments and emotional features. A brief tutorial on classification algorithms in the domain of automated predator identification is also presented through the chapter. Finally, the discussion is summarized and the challenges and open issues in this application domain are discussed. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Unfortunately, not all of us are equally aware of the threats when we use online services. Naive users are generally less aware of security and privacy practices on the Internet and are susceptible to online predators. In this paper, we present a behavioral analysis of Internet users and their susceptibility to online malpractices. We have considered the dataset from the Global Internet User Survey for 10789 respondents to perform a security-oriented statistical analysis of correlated user behavior. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the statistical predictability of susceptible and not-so-susceptible identity theft victims based on their behavior and knowledge of security and privacy practices. We posit that such a study can be used to assess the vulnerability of Internet users and can hence be used to leverage institutional and personal safety on the Internet by promoting online security education, threat awareness, and guided Internet-safe behavior. © 2016 IEEE.",Behavioral Analysis;

To better predict system vulnerabilities, cybersecurity researchers are developing new and more holistic approaches to characterizing cybersecurity system risk. The process must include characterizing the human factors that contribute to cyber security vulnerabilities and risk. Rationality, expertise, and maliciousness are key human characteristics influencing cyber risk within this context, yet maliciousness is poorly characterized in the literature. There is a clear absence of literature pertaining to human factor maliciousness as it relates to cybersecurity and only limited literature relating to aspects of maliciousness in other disciplinary literatures, such as psychology, sociology, and law. In an attempt to characterize human factors as a contribution to cybersecurity risk, the Cybersecurity Collaborative Research Alliance (CSec-CRA) has developed a Human Factors risk framework. This framework identifies the characteristics of an attacker, user, or defender, all of whom may be adding to or mitigating against cyber risk. The maliciousness literature and the proposed maliciousness assessment metrics are discussed within the context of the Human Factors Framework and Ontology. Maliciousness is defined as the intent to harm. Most maliciousness cyber research to date has focused on detecting malicious software but fails to analyze an individual's intent to do harm to others by deploying malware or performing malicious attacks. Recent efforts to identify malicious human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity, include analyzing motives driving insider threats as well as user profiling analyses. However, cyber-related maliciousness is neither well-studied nor is it well understood because individuals are not forced to expose their true selves to others while performing malicious attacks. Given the difficulty of interviewing malicious-behaving individuals and the potential untrustworthy nature of their responses, we aim to explore the maliciousness as a human factor through the observable behaviors and attributes of an individual from their actions and interactions with society and networks, but to do so we will need to develop a set of analyzable metrics. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to review human maliciousness-related literature in diverse disciplines (sociology, economics, law, psychology, philosophy, informatics, terrorism, and cybersecurity); and (2) to identify an initial set of proposed assessment metrics and instruments that might be culled from in a future effort to characterize human maliciousness within the cyber realm. The future goal is to integrate these assessment metrics into holistic cybersecurity risk analyses to determine the risk an individual poses to themselves as well as other networks, systems, and/or users. © 2018 King, Henshel, Flora, Cains, Hoffman and Sample.",Cyber security; Cyber terrorism; Human risk factors; Malicious intent; Metrics; Motivation; Rational behavior,,,,,,,,"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, (2017); Ajzen I., Nature and operation of attitudes, Annu.

What does itmean to be a man in contemporary society? How is masculinity constituted in different media spaces? This growing cultural tension around masculinities has been discussed and analyzed both for general audiences and in burgeoning academic scholarship. What has been typically overlooked, however, is the role that language plays in these mediated performances of masculinity. In Language and Mediated Masculinities, Robert Lawson draws on data from newspapers, social media sites, television programs, and online forums to explore language and masculinities across a range of media contexts. The book offers a critical evaluation of the intersection between language, masculinities, and identities in contemporary society and addresses three key questions: How are masculinities constructed, in both public and private spheres, through linguistic and discursive strategies? How does language about masculinity and men affect (and recreate) gender ideologies in different social, political, and historical contexts? What might the language of men tell us about the state of contemporary gender relations in the twenty-first century? Lawson furthers our understanding of how language is implicated in (re)creating gender ideologies and how it shapes contemporary gender relations. Against a cultural backdrop of rising neoliberalism, ethnic nationalism, online radicalization, networked misogyny, and fractious gender relations, this book is an important contribution to charting how language is used to monitor, evaluate, and police masculinities in online and offline spaces. © Oxford University Press 2023.

Investigators are interested in identifying these perpetrators on Freenet, which supports the anonymous publication and retrieval of data and is widely used for CP trafficking. We confirmed that 70, 000 manifests posted to public forums dedicated to child sexual abuse contained tens of thousands of known CP images including infants and toddlers. About 35% of traffic on Freenet was for these specific manifests. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel approach for investigating these privacy violations. In particular, our approach aims to distinguish whether a neighboring peer is the actual requester of a file or just forwarding the requests for other peers. Our method requires only a single peer that passively analyzes the traffic it is sent by a neighbor. We derive a Bayesian framework that models the observer's decision for whether the neighbor is the downloader, and we show why the sum traffic from downloaders relayed by the neighbor is not a significant source of false positives. We validate our model in simulation, finding near perfect results, and we validate our approach by applying it to real CP-related manifests and actual packet data from Freenet, for which we find a false positive rate of about 2%. Given these results, we argue that our method is an effective investigative method for addressing privacy violations resulting from CP published on Freenet. © 2017 Copyright held by the authors.",,Bayesian frameworks; Child pornographies; False positive; False positive rates; File sharing networks; Privacy violation; Public forums; Statistical detection,,,,,Brain Tumor Funders' Collaborative; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; llinois Institute of Technology,This work was supported in part by a Signature Interdisciplinary Research Area Grant from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

In this paper, we report results from a study aimed at identifying sensitive content in photos from a human-centered perspective. We collected sensitive photos and/or descriptions of sensitive photos from participants and asked them to identify which elements of the photo made each photo sensitive. Using this information, we propose an initial two-level taxonomy of sensitive content categories. This taxonomy may be useful to privacy researchers, online social network designers, policy makers, computer vision researchers and anyone wishing to identify potentially sensitive content in photos. We conclude by providing insights about how these results may be used to enhance computer vision approaches to protecting image privacy. © 2018 IEEE.",,Computer privacy; Computer vision; Social networking (online); Taxonomies; Human perception; On-line social networks; Policy makers; Image enhancement,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1527421); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no.1527421.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no.1527421.

Many malicious websites can still escape detection with various Web spam techniques. In this paper, we first summarize three types of Web spam techniques used by malicious websites, such as redirection spam, hidden IFrame spam, and content hiding spam. We then present a new detection method that adopts the perspective of users and takes screenshots of malicious webpages to invalidate Web spams. The proposed detection method uses a Convolutional Neural Network, which is a class of deep neural networks, as a classification algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, two different experiments have been conducted. First, the proposed method was tested based on a constructed complex dataset. We present comparison results between the proposed method and representative machine learning-based detection algorithms. Second, the proposed method was tested to detect malicious websites in a real-world Web environment for three months. These experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has a better performance and is applicable to a practical Web environment. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network; Machine learning; Malicious website detection,Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Machine learning; Classification algorithm; Comparison result; Detection algorithm; Detection methods; Real world web; Screenshots; Web environment; Web spam; Websites,,,,,"Information Technology Research Center; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation, (IITP-2020-2015-0-00403); Ministry of Science and ICT","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) under Grant IITP-2020-2015-0-00403.","Ranjan A., The Battle against Malicious Websites, (2019); Dombrowski S.C., Gischlar K.L., Durst T., Safeguarding young people from cyber pornography and cyber sexual predation: A major dilemma of the Internet, Child Abuse Rev., J.

Due to rapid and unstoppable technological progress, multiplying opportunities and pushing the boundaries of digital technology and the Internet, the interest of the state and institutions within the state is to raise digital competencies of citizens, with special emphasis on children and youth as the most vulnerable groups of Internet users. The age limit and frequency of use of the Internet by young generations has been moved back a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the concern for information security of young people is increasingly emphasized. If, and to what extent, knowledge of the issue of identification and authentication affects the information security of high school students aged 16 to 19 in the virtual space, the research question addressed by the authors of this paper was to determine which student behaviors pose a potential danger compromising their information security by establishing a correlation between the variables that determine student behavior and the variables used to examine their level of security in a virtual environment. The research was conducted using a questionnaire on a sample of high school students in the Republic of Croatia, the results of which showed that some students practice behaviors that are potentially dangerous, make them vulnerable and easy targets of cyber predators and attackers, which is why there is cause for concern and a need for a additional education of children of primary and secondary school age in the field of information security in the form of the introduction of the subject Digital Literacy. Based on the results, a model for assessing the level of digital literacy of adolescents that affect information literacy can be designed, but also further related research in the field of information literacy of children and youth can be conducted. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The research incorporates analysis of chat logs from convicted felons, to generate a dictionary of sexual approach words. By analysing data across multiple social networks, the study demonstrates the usefulness of such a dictionary of approach words in detection of online predatory behaviour through machine learning algorithms. It also shows the difference between the nature of contents across specific social network platforms. The proposed solution to detect cyberbullying and the domain of approach words are scalable to fit real-life social media, which can have a positive impact on the overall health of online social networks. Different types of cyberbullying have different characteristics. However, existing cyberbullying detection works are not targeted towards any of these specific types. This research is tailored to focus on sexual harassment type of cyberbullying and proposes a novel dictionary of approach words. Since cyberbullying is a growing threat to the mental health and intellectual development of adolescents in the society, models targeted towards the detection of specific type of online bullying or predation should be encouraged among social network researchers.  © 2021 Syed Mahbub et al.",,Computer crime;

Germany’s current artificial intelligence (AI) threats emanate from a range of challenges, including Germany’s growing international ambitions against a background of distinct sociopolitical crisis, social inequality, the risk of political radicalization, an increase in the number and quality of cybercrimes and others. This complex of intermingled challenges makes Germany extremely vulnerable to MUAI at all levels but especially in the area of psychological operations, where the rise of populism and new extremist movements increase the relevance of agenda-setting manipulations in social media and searching systems. Meanwhile, international tensions provide incentive for direct disinformation and defamation campaigns. This situation leads to scenarios where strong regulations based on AI ethics restrict the use of technologies by malicious actors, but also leads to the public perceiving those norms as excessively harsh, raising skepticism around AI in Germany. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Deepfakes; Extremist movements; Germany; Malicious use of artificial intelligence; Psychological security; Rising power; Social media,,,,,,,,"Anheier H., Germany's homegrown Q menace, (2021); Armiento I., A German Startup has a different approach to self-driving cars, (2022); Baierl R., Nitzsche B., Künstliche Intelligenz im deutschen Mittelstand-Empfehlungen für eine erfolgreiche Implementierung, Künstliche Intelligenz im Dienstleistungsmanagement, pp. 314-329, (2021); Bazarkina D., Pashentsev E., Malicious use of artificial intelligence, Russia in Global Affairs, 18, pp. 154-177, (2020); Germany starts enforcing hate speech law, (2018); Boettcher B., Schneider S., Polarisation in Germany-Fuelled but not caused by the corona crisis, pp. 1-15, (2020); Reichsbürger. and ""Selbstverwalter.""

Yet, there has been little research as to how these experiences impact teens' mood over time, or how long these effects may last. To examine the effects of online risk exposure on mood, we asked 68 teens to report their weekly online risk experiences, emotions, and sense of well-being for two months. We found that teens experienced more negative emotions the week that they reported cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content, but these effects were gone one week later. In addition, teens reported a slight increase in positive emotions and mental well-being during weeks they were exposed to other risks. Our results suggest that most of the risks teens in our study experienced online only pose brief negative effects, if any, and initiates a discussion on how our society may overly problematize the negative effects of online risk exposure on teens. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Adolescent online safety; Cyberbullying; Diary study; Explicit content; Information breaches; Privacy; Sexual solicitations,Computer crime; Data privacy; Cyber bullying; Diary study; Explicit content; Information breaches; Sexual solicitations; Risk management,,,,,,,"Adler A., To catch a predator, Columbia Journal of Gender and Law, 21, pp. 130-561, (2012); Aguinis H., Boik R.J., Pierce C.A., A generalized solution for approximating the power to detect effects of categorical moderator variables using multiple regression, Organizational Research Methods, 4, 4, pp. 291-323, (2001); Allen J.R., Of resilience, vulnerability, and a woman who never lived, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 7, 1, pp. 53-71, (1998); Almeida D.M., Resilience and vulnerability to daily stressors assessed via diary methods, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14, 2, pp. 64-68, (2005); Bazelon E., Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy, (2013); Bernstein M.S., Monroy-Hernandez A., Harry D., Andre P., Panovich K., Vargas G.G., 4chan and/b: An analysis of anonymity and ephemerality in a large online community, Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 50-57, (2011); Berriman L., Thomson R., Spectacles of intimacy?

The study also explores whether teens’ short-term coping responses serve to mitigate PTSD or, instead, act as a response to stress from online events. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilized a web-based diary design over the course of two months. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling with repeated measures. Findings: The study confirmed that explicit content exposure, cyberbullying and sexual solicitations (but not information breaches) evoke symptoms of PTSD. Analyses also indicated that teens engage in active and communicative coping after they experience post-traumatic stress, regardless of risk type or frequency. Practical implications: The authors found that teens took active measures to cope with online risks soon after they felt threatened (within a week). Actively coping with stressful situations has been shown to enhance adolescent resilience and reduce long-term negative effects of risk exposure. If these early coping behaviors can be detected, social media platforms may be able to embed effective interventions to support healthy coping processes that can further protect teens against long-term harm from exposure to online risks. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine situational PTSD symptoms related to four types of adolescent online risk exposure within the week exposure occurred. By applying two competing theoretical frameworks (the adolescent resilience framework and transactional theory of stress), the authors show empirical evidence that suggests short-term coping responses are likely a stress reaction to PTSD, not a protective factor against it. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Coping; Cyberbullying; Online privacy; Online safety; Online sexual solicitation; Post-traumatic stress disorder,,,,,,"US National Science Foundation, (CNS-1018302)","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation under Grant CNS-1018302.

Sixty participants were assigned to an honest (n = 30) or deceptive group (n = 30). The deceptive group was instructed to memorize the false biographical details of a fictitious identity. Throughout the interviews, participants were presented with a randomized sequence of control, expected, and unexpected open-ended questions about identity. Responses were audio recorded for detailed examination. Our findings indicate that deceptive participants showed markedly longer latencies and higher error rates when answering expected (requiring deception) and unexpected questions (for which premeditated deception was not possible). Longer response latencies were also observed in participants attempting deception when answering control questions (which necessitated truthful answers). Moreover, a within-subject analysis highlighted that responding to unexpected questions significantly impaired individuals’ performance compared to answering control and expected questions. Leveraging machine-learning algorithms, our approach attained a classification accuracy of 98% in distinguishing deceptive and honest participants. Additionally, a classification analysis on single response levels was conducted. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of merging response latency metrics and error rates with unexpected questioning as a robust method for identity deception detection in investigative interviews. We also discuss significant implications for enhancing interview strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.",,Adult; Deception; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Lie Detection; Machine Learning; Male; Reaction Time; Young Adult; adult; analytical error; article; benchmarking; controlled study; deception; female; human; human experiment; interview; latent period; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; normal human; reaction time; young adult; deception; interview; lie detection; physiology; psychology,,,,,,,"Verschuere B., Ben-Shakhar G., Meijer E., Memory Detection: Theory and Application of the Concealed Information Test, (2011); Sartori G., Agosta S., Zogmaister C., Ferrara S.D., Castiello U., How to accurately detect autobiographical events, Psychol.

At the same time, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the distance education as vital, compulsory and worldwide, for Educational Institutions. The attainments of technology are set at the service of education and the problem of security and privacy in online learning is emerged. This paper focuses on the development of a secure online learning system, which utilizes edge computing and privacy mechanisms, such as trust evaluation from direct and indirect observations.

Researchers have identified some important stages in this pattern. The psychological stages broadly include befriending, information exchange, grooming, and approach. Similarities among the posts of a chat play an important role in differentiating as well as in identifying these stages. In this article a novel similarity measure is constructed which gives high Inter-post-similarity among the chat-posts within a particular behavioral stage and low inter-post-similarity across different behavioral stages. A psychological stage corpus-based dictionary is constructed from mining the terms associated with each stage. The dictionary works as a background knowledge-base to support the similarity measure. To find the inter-post similarity a modified sentence similarity measure is used. The proposed measure gives improved recognition of inter-stage and intra-stage similarity among the chat posts compared with other types of similarity measures. The pairwise inter-post similarity is used for clustering chat-posts into the psychological stages. Results of experiments demonstrate that the new clustering method gives better results than some current clustering methods. © 2014 ASIS&T.",similarity; text mining; text processing,Cluster analysis; Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Text processing; Back-ground knowledge; Behavioral patterns; Clustering methods; Information exchanges; Sentence similarity; similarity; Similarity measure; Text mining; Behavioral research,,,,,,,"Adams P.H., Martell C.H., Topic detection and extraction in chat, Proceedings of the Second IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, pp. 581-588, (2008); Armagh D.S., Battaglia N.L., Use of Computers in the Sexual Exploitation of Children, (2006); Bezdek J.C., Cluster validity with fuzzy sets, Journal of Cybernetics, 3, 3, pp. 58-72, (1974); Bezdek J.C., Mathematical models for systematics and taxonomy, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Numerical Taxonomy, pp. 143-166, (1975); Choo K.K.R., Online Child Grooming: A Literature Review on the Misuse of Social Networking Sites for Grooming Children for Sexual Offences, (2009); Ellis P.D., The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, (2010); Fellbaum C., Wordnet: An Electronic Lexical Database, (1998); Jiang J.J., Conrath D.W., Semantic similarity based on corpus statistics and lexical taxonomy, Proceedings of the International Conference on Research in Computational Linguistics, pp. 19-33, (1997); Krone T., Queensland Police Stings in Online Chat Rooms.

As online communities grow, they place a greater burden on their human moderators, which increases the likelihood that people at risk may be overlooked. This study evaluated the potential for machine learning to assist online peer support by directing moderators' attention where it is most needed. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an automated triage system and the extent to which it influences moderator behavior. Methods: A machine learning classifier was trained to prioritize forum messages as green, amber, red, or crisis depending on how urgently they require attention from a moderator. This was then launched as a set of widgets injected into a popular online peer support forum hosted by ReachOut.com, an Australian Web-based youth mental health service that aims to intervene early in the onset of mental health problems in young people. The accuracy of the system was evaluated using a holdout test set of manually prioritized messages. The impact on moderator behavior was measured as response ratio and response latency, that is, the proportion of messages that receive at least one reply from a moderator and how long it took for these replies to be made. These measures were compared across 3 periods: before launch, after an informal launch, and after a formal launch accompanied by training. Results: The algorithm achieved 84% f-measure in identifying content that required a moderator response. Between prelaunch and post-training periods, response ratios increased by 0.9, 4.4, and 10.5 percentage points for messages labelled as crisis, red, and green, respectively, but decreased by 5.0 percentage points for amber messages. Logistic regression indicated that the triage system was a significant contributor to response ratios for green, amber, and red messages, but not for crisis messages. Response latency was significantly reduced (P<.001), between the same periods, by factors of 80%, 80%, 77%, and 12% for crisis, red, amber, and green messages, respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the triage system made a significant and unique contribution to reducing the time taken to respond to green, amber, and red messages, but not to crisis messages, after accounting for moderator and community activity. Conclusions: The triage system was generally accurate, and moderators were largely in agreement with how messages were prioritized. It had a modest effect on response ratios, primarily because moderators were already more likely to respond to high priority content before the introduction of triage. However, it significantly and substantially reduced the time taken for moderators to respond to prioritized content. Further evaluations are needed to assess the impact of mistakes made by the triage algorithm and how changes to moderator responsiveness impact the well-being of forum members. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This provides a platform to connect, to share and to transfer knowledge. Every user gives enough of individual information in their record, for example, name, age, gender, email-Id, phone number, current town, profession, educational details, movies, sports, likes and dislikes, current location and so forth. Some users (cyber predators) use these information's against the adolescents to harass them over the Internet in an illegal and deceptive way. Adolescents are easy target for the cyber predators, because they easily believe on others. Adolescents find someone trustworthy and start sharing their personal information. In this research work, we conducted a survey on adolescents. We tried to establish a relationship amongst cyber bullying, trust and level of information shared and with the help of this we figured out the root cause of cyber bullying. We also calculated the degree of cyber bullying in the adolescents with respect to different level of shared information. © 2015 IEEE.",Cyber bullying; Cyber predator; Cyber victim; Information shared; Social Networking Sites (SNS); Trust,Information use; Cyber bullying; Cyber predator; Cyber victim; Information shared; Social networking sites; Trust; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Hosseinmardi H., Han R., Lv Q., Mishra S., Towards understanding cyberbullying behavior in a semianonymous social network, 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014); Patchin J.W., Hinduja S., Bullies move beyond the schoolyard; A preliminary look at cyberbullying, Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice, 4, 2, (2006); Glossary of Cyberbullying Terms.

Timely detection of the objectionable content is very important for its prevention and reduction. This article explores and spotlights diversity of definitions of cyber-Aggression, cyberbulling, and cyber-grooming; analyzes current categorization systems and taxonomies; identifies the targets, target categories, and subcategories of the subjects of the objectionable content research; analyzes the ambiguity of the linguistic terms in the domain; reviews present databases gathered for researching the field; explores types of features used for modeling systems for automatic detection; and examines methods for automatic detection and/or prediction of the objectionable content. The results point to directions of system development for tracing transformations of objectionable content over time on different online social platforms.  © 2021 ACM.",automatic hate speech detection; Cyber-Aggression; cyber-grooming; cyber-predators; cyberbulluing,Computer crime; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; % reductions; Automatic Detection; Automatic hate speech detection; Cybe-aggression; Cybe-grooming; Cybe-predator; Cyber bullying; Cyberbulluing; Online social medias; Speech detection; Research challenges; Linguistics,,,,,,,"Aggrawal N., 2018.

Particularly, the emphasis is placed on the official sites of public institutions on Facebook, such as kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and all institutions dealing with children. One of the source key issues is the ability to track these public pages by malicious visitors. The main point is the developed algorithm that analyzes any photo, recognizes kid(s), and blurs it during the upload photo onto the page of the social network.

Apart from the data generated across digital devices and the use of diverse technology that slows down the traditional digital forensic investigation strategies. Dynamically scrutinizing the concealed or sparse metadata matches from the less frequent archives of evidence spread across heterogeneous sources and finding their association with other artifacts across the collection is still a horrendous task for the investigators. The effort of this article via unique pockets (UP), unique groups (UG), and unique association (UA) model is to address the exclusive challenges mixed up in identifying incoherent associations that are buried well within the meager metadata field-value pairs.

In this scenario, the issue of online faked identities is more and more present, with the phenomena of identity alteration, identity theft and identity fraud. To date, there are no systems able to detect people who subscribe or authenticate an online service with faked personal information. Moreover, the existing validated lie detection techniques are not suitable to be applied in the online environment. Starting from a previous study, this paper investigates the possibility to detect faked identities recording keystroke dynamics, while the user is filling an online subscription form with personal – real or faked, information. Cognitively overloading liars through few unexpected questions, we demonstrated that it is possible to recognize the deceivers with an accuracy of 85%. To automatically detect liars, three machine-learning classifiers were trained on 40 liars and 40 truth-tellers, and tested on 10 unseen liars and 10 truth-tellers. Liars have proved to be distinguishable from truth-tellers as they make more errors and are slower in typing unexpected information about their identity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Faked identity; Identity verification; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detection; Online identity,Crime; Dynamics; Learning systems; Faked identity; Identity verification; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detection; Online identity; Online systems,,,,,,,"Internet Usage Statistics; Gross R., Acquisti A., Information revelation and privacy in online social networks, Proceedings of the 2005 ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, pp. 71-80, (2005); Siibak A., Casanova’s of the virtual world.

In this paper, we test the differences between subjects who report their true identity and the ones who give fake identity responding to control, simple, and complex questions. Asking complex questions is a new procedure for increasing liars' cognitive load, which is presented in this paper for the first time. The experiment consisted in an identity verification task, during which response time and errors were collected. Twenty participants were instructed to lie about their identity, whereas the other 20 were asked to respond truthfully. Different machine learning (ML) models were trained, reaching an accuracy level around 90-95% in distinguishing liars from truth tellers based on error rate and response time. Then, to evaluate the generalization and replicability of these models, a new sample of 10 participants were tested and classified, obtaining an accuracy between 80 and 90%. In short, results indicate that liars may be efficiently distinguished from truth tellers on the basis of their response times and errors to complex questions, with an adequate generalization accuracy of the classification models. © 2018 Monaro, Gamberini, Zecchinato and Sartori.",Complex questions; Deception detection; Faked identities; Lie detection; Reaction times,,,,,,,,"Agosta S., Sartori G., The autobiographical IAT: a review, Front.

A range of online sexual activities may be of interest in forensic mental health evaluations (FMHE), including those which are clearly illegal or those which are legal but functionally problematic. Online sexual offenses will clearly prompt forensic evaluators to consider the role of the Internet in these offending behaviors. The Internet may also be relevant in forensic evaluations of contact sexual offending including informing on history of mixed or cross-over offending, and Internet-facilitated contact offenses. A review of Internet-data may span several online domains, many of which provide the user with substantial anonymity and would likely not be available to the evaluator unless provided through the process of discovery.

This chapter identifies this digital abuse phenomenon by comparing and contrasting face-to-face versus digital sexual harassment. More specifically, this chapter contributes to the understanding of haptic communication and sexual harassment, or sexual harassment that occurs using physical touch behavior in combination with virtual touch in both physical and virtual settings in social interactions. The negative effects of digital sexual harassment emphasized in this chapter include mental, emotional, and social consequences that may be detrimental to a person’s quality of life. As sexual harassment through haptic communication continues to impact workers in organizations, researchers and practitioners may need to develop strategies to cope with this form of abuse. Future directions for haptic communication sexual harassment scholarship are also discussed. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Lisa M.

By reviewing 224 research papers, we identified 10 characteristics of technology that facilitate sexual abuse: covertness, publicness, anonymity, evolution, boundlessness, reproducibility, accessibility, indispensability, malleability, and opaqueness. We also analyzed how technology assists victims and other stakeholders in coping with and responding to sexual abuse. Our research questions examined the challenges in using technology to address sexual abuse too. For instance, its use by victims can lead to revictimization. To address technology's challenges, we offer recommendations and suggest new research directions. These findings about the dual nature of technology can inform research and development toward better support for victims of sexual abuse.  © 2022 IEEE.",,Body of knowledge; Contextualize; Reproducibilities; Research and development; Research papers; Research questions; Technology challenges,,,,,Laboratory for Education and Research in Secure Systems Engineering; Vesta Social Innovation Technologies Inc.; Mitacs,"Funding text 1: VIII.

This increase in popularity has also heightened safety concerns, as virtual sexual assault against children and the youth is on the rise. The issue of sexual abuse in the metaverse is becoming increasingly controversial due to the gaps in the current regulatory framework that result from the uncertain consequences of such virtual crimes. Drawing on an online survey of female users of Zepeto (n = 343), a metaverse social network platform where users interact with others while creating personalized avatars and virtual spaces, this study aims to explore how female users interpret the risk of sexual harassment in Zepeto, examining the triggers of emotional distress and behavioral change that result from such risk assessments by users. It investigates how these interpretations and responses vary depending on their sense of presence and engagement in the virtual environment and identification with their avatars and how all these processes differ between adolescent and adult female users. Overall, this study provides insights into the complex dynamics of virtual victimization. The findings could inform the development of regulatory frameworks that protect users from virtual sexual assault and create a safer environment for all users, especially the youngest generations.

These cybercrimes are common against children, demanding the implementation of automated systems and models to detect and counteract these crimes. By keeping in view the growing importance of AI-enabled cybersecurity systems, this article provides insights regarding implementing the relevant systems and models to counteract cybercrimes against children in Pakistan. The researchers reviewed current studies witnessing the performance, reliability, and results of AI implementation in different countries to relate their possible potential further to detect, takedown, and trace online violence against children effectively. Findings showed that AI-enabled software, i.e., Spotlight, SomeBuddy, Google AI Tool, etc., and models such as DAPHNE, iCOP toolkit, and PrevBOT can identify and takedown any indecent activity against children. Besides, detecting the perpetrators’ URLs, domains, and personal emails can further help the children resume internet usage in a healthy online environment. Thus, it is concluded that the internet technology is also creating vectors for abuse and exploitation against children. Harnessing powerful technology, i.e., AI, to analyze and manage the data can also enrich investigative functions. Towards this, local government and law enforcement agencies should resort to suggested tools that may identify even keywords and images. Further, the researchers have provided policy recommendations and discussed the limitations accordingly. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Children; Cyberbullying; Cybercrimes; Extortion; Internet; Online child sexual abuse,,,,,,,,"Aiello L.M., McFarland D., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8851, (2014); Alhumaid K., Habes M., Salloum S.A., Examining the factors influencing the mobile learning usage during COVID-19 pandemic: An integrated SEM-ANN method, IEEE Access, 9, July, pp. 102567-102578, (2021); Violence against Children Continues Unabated in Pakistan’s Punjab Province, (2021); Bhatele K.R., Shrivastava H., Kumari N., The role of artificial intelligence in cyber security, January, pp. 170-192, (2019); Caldwell M., Andrews J.T.A., Tanay T., Griffin L.D., AI-enabled future crime, Crime Science, 9, 1, pp. 1-13, (2020); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8851, pp. 412-427, (2014); Chandra M., Reduction of cyber crimes by effective use of artificial intelligence techniques, International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE), 4, pp. 8643-8645, (2019); Charalambous E., Kavallieros D., Brewster B., Leventakis G., Koutras N., Papalexandratos G., Combatting cybercrime and sexual exploitation of children: An open source toolkit, Open Source Intelligence Investigation, (2016); Child Abuse and Neglect What is Child Abuse and Neglect?, (2006); Coole M., Evans D., Medbury J., Artificial Intelligence in Security: Opportunities and Implications, (2021); SomeBuddy, pp. 1-14, (2019); Detrick H., Google’s New AI Tool to Fight Child Sexual Abuse Will Help Reviewers Scan 700% More Material, (2018); Forensics D., Griffeye; (2021), (2021); Dilek S., Applications of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Combating Cyber Crimes: A Review., 6, 1, pp. 21-39, (2017); Dupont B., Stevens Y., Westermann H., Joyce M., Artificial intelligence in the context of crime and criminal justice, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2021); Durkin K.F., Encyclopedia of cyber behavior, January, (2017); The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Protecting Children in the Digital Space, (2021); Erokhina E.V., Letuta T.V., Juvenile Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence System, 156, Iscde, pp. 607-611, (2020); 146 Children Worldwide Saved in an Operation Targeting Child Abuse Online, (2022); Finch A., Ryckman L., Strategies to prevent online sexual abuse of children, A Systematic Review of the Literature Protocol.

Although it is rather commonly known that cyberspace is a battlefield, and almost every individual, organization or even state may fall victim to malicious hackers or greedy cybercriminals, the members of the public rarely seem to think of other sources of threat. Thus, in an attempt to raise the general awareness, this paper presents an additional number of selected, often unsuspected actors that shape and influence the cyberspace of today: nation-state actors, cyberterrorists, hacktivists and trolls. The motives of each actor, their modus operandi and the most significant representatives have also been discussed. Being aware of the existence and nature of each actor helps one better understand the threat they pose, as well as grasp the significance of the cybersecurity measures. © 2020 ACM.",Cyber threat; Cyberspace; Cyberspace actors; Cyberterrorists; Hacktivists; Nation-state actors; Trolls,Personal computing; Security of data; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cybercriminals; Cyberspaces; Modus operandi; Computers,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (833042)","Funding text 1: This work is funded under SIMARGL project, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 833042.; Funding text 2: This work is funded under SIMARGL project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 833042.","Ablon L., The motivations of cyber threat actors and their use and monetization of stolen data: Hearings before the committee on financial services subcommittee on terrorism and illicit finance, United States House, 115th Cong, (2018); Addawood A., Badawy A., Lerman K., Ferrara E., Linguistic cues to deception: Identifying political trolls on social media, Proceedings of the Thirteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2019), (2019); Afifi-Sabet K., What Is Hacktivism?, (2018); Ahmad R., Yunos Z., A dynamic cyber terrorism framework, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, (2012); Entity A., Urban Dictionary: Troll, (2002); Cyberterrorism: The invisible threat stealth cyber predators in a climate of escalating risk, Foreign Affairs, 89, (2010); Arthur C., Lulzsec: What they did, who they were and how they were caught, The Guardian, (2013); Baraniuk C., Ten Hacktivists Who Shook the Web, (2013); Beggs C., Cyber-terrorism in Australia, IGI Global, (2008); Benton B., The Misinformers: Edward Snowden, Aaron Swartz and the Troubled Relationship between Hacktivists, Mass Media and American Government, (2015); Bieda D., Halawi L., Cyberspace: A venue for terrorism, Issues in Information Systems, 16, (2015); Bishop J., Tackling Internet Abuse in Great Britain: Towards A Framework for Classifying Severities of 'Flame Trolling', (2012); Bishop J., The effect of de-individuation of the internet troller on criminal procedure implementation: An interview with a hater, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, (2013); Buchan R., Cyberspace , non-state actors and the obligation to prevent transboundary harm, Journal of Conflict & Security Law, (2016); Caldwell T., Hacktivism goes hardcore, Network Security, 2015, 5, pp. 12-17, (2015); Cambria E., Chandra P., Sharma A., Hussain A., Do Not Feel the Trolls, (2010); Charlish A., Polish Deputy Minister Resigns over Judge Trolling Scandal, (2019); What Is Hacktivism?; Coleman G., Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy, (2014); Cook C., Schaafsma J., Antheunis M., Under the bridge: An in-depth examination of online trolling in the gaming context, New Media & Society, 20, 9, pp. 3323-3340, (2018); Denning D.E., Cyberterrorism Testimony before the Special Oversight Panel on Terrorism Committee on Armed Services U.S. House of Representatives, (2000); Dogan B., Contextualizing hacktivism: The criminalization of redhack, CARGC Papers, 10, (2019); Viacheslav Dziundziuk Dr., Stopping cyber terror countries must work together to thwart efforts of internet criminals, Per Concordiam, Journal of European Security and Defense Issues, 2; Eddy M., Cyber warfare is still a free-for-all, PC Magazine, (2019); Fowler K., Data Breach Preparation and Response, (2016); Gargano F., Three Common Threat Actors and the One You Might Not Know about, (2019); Gerber T.P., Zavisca J., Does Russian propaganda work?, The Washington Quarterly, 39, 2, pp. 79-98, (2016); Onet.pl: Deputy Justice Minister behind Campaign to Discredit Judges, (2019); Goldman Z.K., Terrorism 2.0?

The text argues that a safeguarding dystopia results in docile children, rather than safe ones, and that we should stop seeing technology as the sole solution to online safeguarding. The reader will, through reading this book, gain a deeper understanding of the current policy arena in online safeguarding, what causes children to beocme upset online, and the doomed nature of safeguarding solutions. The book also features a detailed analysis of issues surrounding content filtering, access monitoring, surveillance, image recognition, and tracking.

Children at increasingly younger ages come into contact with electronic devices, exposing them to cyberbullying and grooming. The article focuses on a theoretical and practical analysis of child grooming in the context of contemporary technologies and identifies challenges related to education in today’s system. Various forms of cyberbullying, such as trolling, hate speech, sexting, and grooming, are discussed in the article. These experiences can lead to serious emotional and social consequences, even to suicide attempts. Special attention is given to child grooming, a process of building a relationship with a child for sexual exploitation, which poses an increasing threat to the youngest users of the Internet. The authors draw attention to the potential dangers of internet applications that allow perpetrators to hide their identity and establish private contacts with children. They also describe the role of schools in the digital world of children, emphasizing the need for education on online safety, the development of digital citizen-ship skills, and collaboration with parents. The authors concludes with a discussion of educational challenges related to child grooming and advocates for the creation of a separate school subject dedicated to online safety, ethics, awareness of threats, and cri-sis management skills in cyberspace. This proposal includes diverse modules such as basics of online safety, privacy protection, cyberbullying, online law, and safe use of modern technologies, aiming to comprehensively prepare students for internet use. © 2023, the Authors.",cyberbullying; education; hate speech; sexting; trolling,,,,,,,,"Bak A., Jak małe dzieci korzystają z urządzeń mobilnych?

It is a challenging bullying problem occurring in a new territory. Online bullying can be particularly damaging and upsetting because it's usually anonymous or hard to trace. In this paper, the proposed method is utilizing a dataset of real world conversations (i.e. Pairs of questions and answers between cyber predator and the victim), in which each predator question is manually annotated in terms of severity using a numeric label. We approach the issue as a sequential data modelling approach, in which the predator's questions are formulated using a Singular Value Decomposition representation. The motivation of this procedure is to study the accuracy of predicting the level of cyber bullying attack using classification methods and also to examine potential patterns between the lingustic style of each predator. More specifically, unlike previous approaches that consider a fixed window of a cyber-predator's questions within a dialogue, we exploit the whole question set and model it as a signal, whose magnitude depends on the degree of bullying content. Using feature weighting and dimensionality reduction techniques, each signal is straightforwardly parsed by a neural network that forecasts the level of insult within a question given a window between two and three previous questions. Throughout the time series modeling experiments, an interesting discovery was made. By applying SVD on the time series data and taking into account the second dimension (since the first is usually modeling trivial dependencies between instances and attributes) we observed that its plot was very similar to the plot of the class attribute. By applying a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, the similarity of the aforementioned signals was proved to exist, providing an immediate indicator for the severity of cyber bullying within a given dialogue. © 2014 IEEE.",cyberbullying; Dynamic time warping; singular value decomposition; SVM feature selection; time series analysis,Computer crime; Data mining; Personal digital assistants; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Communication technologies; Cyber bullying; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Dynamic time warping; Dynamic time warping algorithms; Feature weighting; Time series modeling; Time series analysis,,,,,,,"The National Crime Prevention; Willard N.E., Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats: Responding to the Challenge of Online Social Aggression, Threats, and Distress, (2007); Cambria E., Wang H., White B., Guest editorial: Big social data analysis, Knowledge-Based Systems, 69, pp. 1-2, (2014); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop-Working Notes Papers, (2012); Xue Y.Z., Hong L., Davison B.D., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Detection of Harassment on Web 2.0 in CAW 2.0 '09: Proceedings of the 1st Content Analysis in Web 2.0 Workshop, (2009); Kontostathis A., Reynolds K., Garron A., Edwards L., Detecting cyberbullying: Query terms and techniques, Proceedings of the 5th Annual Acm Web Science Conference, pp. 195-204, (2013); Kontostathis A., West W., Garron A., Reynolds K., Edwards L., Identifying Predators Using Chatcoder 2.0-notebook for Pan at Clef, (2012); Lau R., Xia Y Ye.

This study focuses on grammatical ambiguous sentences, grammatical ambiguous sentences are ambiguities that occur due to incorrect grammar, but this ambiguity will disappear once it is used within a sentence. Ambiguous sentences become a big problem when they are processed by a computer. In order for the computer to interpret ambiguous words correctly, this study seeks to develop detection of Indonesian ammbiguous sentences using Boyer Moore algorithm. This algorithm matches ambiguous sentences that are inserted as input with the data set. Then the sentence is being detected whether it contains ambiguous sentences, by calculating the percentage of similarity using cosine similarity method. Cosine similarity system is able to find out the meaning of the sentence. In the data set, the number of ambiguous sentences that can be collected is 50 words. The 50 words consist of ambiguous words data, ambiguous sentences, and ambiguous sentence meanings. This system trial was carried out for 200 times and the accuracy level was 0.935, precision was 0.9320, and Recall was 0.8. While the F-Measure was 0.8061.

We operationalize culture through the GLOBE dimensions, a set of nine variables measuring cultural practices and another nine measuring values. Our observations of self-disclosure come from the privacy settings of approximately 200,000 randomly sampled Facebook users who designated a geographical network in 2009. We model privacy awareness as a function of one or more GLOBE variables with demographic covariates, evaluating the relative influence of each factor. In the top-performing models, we find that the majority of the cultural dimensions are significantly related to privacy awareness behavior. We also find that the hypothesized directions of several of these relationships, based largely on cultural attitudes towards threat mitigation, are confirmed. © 2016",Culture; Facebook; GLOBE; Privacy; Self-disclosure; Social networks,Attitude; Humans; Privacy; Self Disclosure; Social Media; attitude; human; privacy; self disclosure; social media,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1028394, IIS-1526736, OIA-1028394); National Science Foundation, NSF","The authors thank Minas Gjoka for access to and assistance with the data.

The usefulness of these systems depend on the quality of data that can be used for training. Data in the domain are scarce, sensitive, and emotionally taxing for annotators. NLP researchers approximate victimization conversations using transcripts from internet stings performed by either vigilantes or LEOs, with an implicit assumption that vigilante or LEO conversations represent the victimization process. Psychology research, however, states that underage victim chats differ from internet stings in goal and modus operandi. We present a methodology and observations from annotating a corpus of victim, vigilante, and LEO conversations with convicted predators with the goal of comparing these chats. The corpus is annotated for stages and tactics of the victimization process described within psychology research. As predicted by psychological research, we found significant differences in the three classes of chats that are usually not taken into account in chat classification. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Law enforcement officers; Modus operandi; Psychological research; Quality of data; Victimisation; Crime,,,,,,,"Aitken Susan, Gaskell Danielle, Hodkinson Alan, Online sexual grooming: exploratory comparison of themes arising from male offenders' communications with male victims compared to female victims, Deviant Behavior, 39, 9, pp. 1170-1190, (2018); Albahar Marwan, Almalki Jameel, Deep-fakes: Threats and countermeasures systematic review, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 97, 22, pp. 3242-3250, (2019); Bada Michael, Eckert Miriam, Evans Donald, Garcia Kristin, Shipley Krista, Sitnikov Dmitry, Baumgartner William A., Bretonnel Cohen K., Verspoor Karin, Blake Judith A., Et al., Concept annotation in the craft corpus, BMC Bioinformatics, 13, 1, (2012); Barber Connie, Bettez Silvia, Deconstructing the online grooming of youth: Toward improved information systems for detection of online sexual predators, (2014); Bayerl Petra S, Lungen Harald, Gut Ulrike, Paul Karsten I, Methodology for reliable schema development and evaluation of manual annotations, Proceedings of the Workshop on Knowledge Markup and Semantic Annotation at the Second International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2003), (2003); Bayerl Petra Saskia, Paul Karsten Ingmar, What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations? a meta-analytic investigation, Computational Linguistics, 37, 4, pp. 699-725, (2011); Beauregard Eric, Leclerc Benoit, Lussier Patrick, Decision making in the crime commission process: Comparing rapists, child molesters, and victim-crossover sex offenders, Criminal Justice and Behavior, 39, 10, pp. 1275-1295, (2012); Bergen Emilia, Antfolk Jan, Jern Patrick, Alanko Katarina, Santtila Pekka, Adults' sexual interest in children and adolescents online: A quasi-experimental study, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 7, 2, (2013); Black Pamela J, Wollis Melissa, Woodworth Michael, Hancock Jeffrey T, A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child abuse & neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Bogdanova Dasha, Rosso Paolo, Solorio Thamar, On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd workshop in computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Bowen Glenn A, Naturalistic inquiry and the saturation concept: a research note, Qualitative research, 8, 1, pp. 137-152, (2008); Briggs Peter, Simon Walter T, Simonsen Stacy, An exploratory study of internet-initiated sexual offenses and the chat room sex offender: Has the internet enabled a new typology of sex offender?, Sexual Abuse, 23, 1, pp. 72-91, (2011); Cano Amparo Elizabeth, Fernandez Miriam, Alani Harith, Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International conference on social informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Chiang Emily, Grant Tim, Deceptive identity performance: offender moves and multiple identities in online child abuse conversations, Applied Linguistics, 40, 4, pp. 675-698, (2019); Colton Matthew, Roberts Susan, Van-stone Maurice, Sexual abuse by men who work with children, Journal of child sexual abuse, 19, 3, pp. 345-364, (2010); DeHart Dana, Dwyer Gregg, Seto Michael C, Moran Robert, Letourneau Elizabeth, Schwarz-Watts Donna, Internet sexual solicitation of children: a proposed typology of offenders based on their chats, e-mails, and social network posts, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 23, 1, pp. 77-89, (2017); Diaz Maria, Panangadan Anand, Natural language-based integration of online review datasets for identification of sex trafficking businesses, 2020 IEEE 21st International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI), pp. 259-264, (2020); Ebrahimi Mohammadreza, Suen Ching Y, Ormandjieva Olga, Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); van Gijn-Grosvenor Evianne L., Lamb Michael E., Behavioural differences between online sexual groomers approaching boys and girls, Journal of Child Sexual Abuse, 25, 5, pp. 577-596, (2016); Gillespie Alisdair A, Child protection on the internet-challenges for criminal law, Child & Fam.

Assistance in prioritizing cases of sexual exploitation of potentially risky conversations is crucial. While attempts to automatically triage conversations for the risk of sexual exploitation of minors have been attempted in the past, most computational models use features which are not representative of the grooming process that is used by investigators. Accurately annotating an offender corpus for use with machine learning algorithms is difficult because the stages of the grooming process feed into one another and are non-linear. In this paper we propose a method for labeling risk, tied to stages and themes of the grooming process, using fuzzy sets. We develop a neural network model that uses these fuzzy membership functions of each line in a chat as input and predict the risk of interaction. © 2019 IEEE.",,Fuzzy neural networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Membership functions; Computational model; Fuzzy membership function; Neural network model; Non linear; Risk perception,,,,,Purdue Research Foundation,ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was partially supported by Purdue Research Foundation.,"Online Enticement of Children: An In-Depth Analysis of CyberTipLine Reports, (2017); Whittle H.C., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A.R., Victimsfffdfffdfffd voices: The impact of online grooming and sexual abuse, Universal Journal of Psychology, 1, 2, pp. 59-71, (2013); Chiu M.M., Seigfried-Spellar K.C., Ringenberg T.R., Exploring detection of contact vs. fantasy online sexual offenders in chats with minors: Statistical discourse analysis of self-disclosure and emotion words, Child Abuse & Neglect, 81, pp. 128-138, (2018); Connell R.O., A Typology of Child Cybersexploitation and Online Grooming Practices, (2003); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse & Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Babchishin K.M., Hanson R.K., VanZuylen H., Online child pornography offenders are different: A meta-analysis of the characteristics of online and offline sex offenders against children, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44, 1, pp. 45-66, (2015); Parapar J., Losada D.E., Barreiro A., A learning-based approach for the identification of sexual predators in chat logs, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Barber C., Bettez S., Deconstructing the Online Grooming of Youth: Toward Improved Information Systems for Detection of Online Sexual Predators, (2014); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring highlevel features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); Bayerl P.S., Paul K.I., What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations.

Due to increased caseloads, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) researchers are developing triage tools to help law enforcement officers (LEOs) identify potential enticement conversations. However, the datasets most readily available consist of Internet sting data where an officer or vigilante, known as a decoy, imitates a minor while talking to a potential solicitor. Psychology researchers note motivations of decoys and LEOs differ from those of at-risk minors and thus the conversations are likely incongruent. Previous research in the area is limited. Existing studies either do not include all three dataset types (victim, decoy, and LEOs) or examine usage of grooming stages and grooming strategies by each group, but not how these constructs intermingle. We extend the literature by examining the usage and sequencing of grooming stages in a chat, and the use of grooming strategies in grooming stages for all three groups. We find the greatest differences in the flow of grooming conversations with decoys, victims, and LEOs exist within the risk assessment, meeting, and sexual stages. Implications for LEOs, ML and NLP researchers are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Child sexual abuse; Computer-assisted crime; Online grooming,Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems;

The book conceptualizes the types of violence, abuse, neglect, and/or trauma that factor into ACEs. It also explores the psychopathological outcomes of ACEs among children, including neurodevelopmental and psychosocial mechanisms. By drawing on cross-cultural perspectives, the authors provide insight into the variations between the adversity and trauma children experience. Sections also cover preventive measures, risk factors and various forms of interventional treatment, making this book a core read for psychologists, physicians, social workers, educators and researchers in the field. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

We all either enjoy it, struggle with it, or may have been victims of it. Sexuality is not just about sex, but about human sexual function, the physiology of sex, the hormones involved and how they affect us, and the cultural norms related to it. Sexual function and dysfunction are closely tied to one’s self-esteem, self-respect, and to relationships with intimate partners. Human Sexuality: Function, Dysfunction, Paraphilias, and Relationships, explores the interplay of intimacy and sexuality; how it can enhance relationships, and how it can negatively affect them, or be affected by them. When individuals or partners encounter sexual problems or dysfunctions it can have a long-lasting affect both biologically and psychologically. Dr. Rokach explores the causes and the reasons that these dysfunctions are maintained, and successful treatment methods. Chapters on sexual offenses and paraphilias and what treatment options are available to sexual offenders are also included. This book is the first book to place sexuality where it belongs, within the context of relationships demonstrating how sexuality relates to intimacy by both enhancing and negatively affecting it. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

An online survey was conducted where participants (N = 202) were provided with three different visualizations of the detection screen (labeled text only, percentage of abusive text messages only, and labeled and percentage of abusive text messages) to understand a) What is the threshold of abusive text messages that would motivate the user to consider themselves in an abusive relationship? (30%, 50%, or 70% abusive text messages) b) What is the most effective way to visualize the results of the detection classifier that would invoke user trust and encourage them to receive necessary help? c) Which visualizations nudge users to trust machine learning-based classification results? We found the Text only condition to show significant differences across all three research questions and will use these results for future iterations of SecondLook. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data visualization; Digital dating abuse; User trust,Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Surveys; Visualization; Classification results; Condition; Digital dating abuse; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Mobile phone applications; Online surveys; Research questions; User perceptions; User trust; Data visualization,,,,,,,"Bland J.M., Altman D.G., Multiple significance tests: The Bonferroni method, BMJ, 170, 310, (1995); Bok S., Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life, (2011); Chatzimparmpas A., Martins R.M., Jusufi I., Kucher K., Rossi F., Kerren A., The state of the art in enhancing trust in machine learning models with the use of visualizations, Computer Graphics Forum, pp. 713-756, (2020); de Choudhury M., Gamon M., Counts S., Horvitz E., Predicting Depression via Social, Media, (2013); Dinakar K., Reichart R., Lieberman H., Modeling the Detection of Textual Cyberbullying, (2011); Ipeirotis P.G., Analyzing the amazon mechanical turk marketplace, XRDS: Crossroads. the ACM Magazine for Students, 17, 2, pp. 16-21, (2010); Marsh S., Dibben M.R., The role of trust in information science and technology, Ann.

Challenges in defining online sexual grooming, variations in its prevalence, and evolving offender strategies necessitate a cohesive global legislative effort to combat child sexual abuse. This study employs a legal and psychological perspective, utilizing an integrative review methodology to comprehensively understand online sexual grooming. The objective is to formulate a holistic risk prevention and management framework. Examining risk and vulnerability identification mechanisms through empirical research, the study advocates for an integrated approach, encompassing psychosocial and preventive strategies to combat cybercrime. The proposed framework, comprising primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention measures, aims to strengthen the global fight against the disturbing phenomenon of online sexual grooming and its detrimental impact on children, adolescents, and society as a whole. © 2024, IGI Global.

Although offenders may try to conceal their identity, these sexts often include hand, knuckle, and nail bed imagery. Objective: We present a novel biometric hand verification tool designed to identify online child sexual exploitation offenders from images or videos based on biometric/forensic features extracted from hand regions. The system can match and authenticate hand component imagery against a constrained custody suite reference of a known subject by employing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. Data: We conducted experiments on two hand datasets: Purdue University and Hong Kong. In particular, the Purdue dataset collected for this study allowed us to evaluate the system performance on various parameters, with specific emphasis on camera distance and orientation. Methods: To explore the performance and reliability of the biometric verification models, we considered several parameters, including hand orientation, distance from the camera, single or multiple fingers, architecture of the models, and performance loss functions. Results: Results showed the best performance for pictures sampled from the same database and with the same image capture conditions. Conclusion: The authors conclude the biometric hand verification tool offers a robust solution that will operationally impact law enforcement by allowing agencies to investigate and identify online child sexual exploitation offenders more effectively. We highlight the strength of the system and the current limitations. © 2024",Biometric identification; Forensic investigative tool; Hands; Knuckles; Online child sexual exploitation,algorithm; Article; biometry; data extraction; forensic imaging; human; image analysis; image quality; information processing; nail bed,,,,,"Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP; Lafayette Police Department; Office of Justice Programs, OJP; U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ, (2019-MC-FX-K063, 15PJDP-21-GK-03269-MECP); U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ","We would like to acknowledge the Tippecanoe County Prosecutor's Office, Tippecanoe High Tech Crime Unit, and Lafayette Police Department for their support in carrying out this research project.

However, such information sharing is not always authentic because people, sometimes, also share their perceptions and fabricated information on OSNs. Thus, verification of online posts is important to maintain reliability over this useful communication medium. To address this concern, multiple approaches have been investigated including machine learning, natural language processing, source authentication, empirical studies, web semantics, and modeling/simulations, but the problem still persists. This research proposes an effective synergy-based rumor verification method along with a weighted-mean reputation management system to mitigate the spread of rumors over OSN. The model was formally verified through Colored Petri-Nets while its semantic behavior was analyzed through ontologies. Moreover, a third-party Facebook application was developed for proof of concept, and users’ acceptance and usability analysis was performed through Technology Acceptance Model and Self-Efficacy scale. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be used as an effective tool for the identification of rumors and it has the potential to improve the quality of users’ online experience. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Colored Petri-Net; Online social networks; Ontology; Rumor verification; Synergy; Web semantics; Weighted reputation management,Information dissemination; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Petri nets; Semantic Web; Semantics; User profile; Colored Petri Nets; Information sharing; Ontology's; Reputation management; Rumor verification; Social connection; Synergy; Verification systems; Web semantics; Weighted reputation management; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Bertino E., Friedman R., Extending social networks with delegation, Comput Secur, 70, pp. 546-564, (2017); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Zeshan F., Janczewski L., Ali M., Chaudary M.H., Friedman R., A relation-aware multiparty access control, J Intell Fuzzy Syst, 37, 1, pp. 227-239, (2019); Ahmad A., Azhar A., Naqvi S., Nawaz A., Arshad S., Zeshan F., Salih A.O., A methodology for sender-oriented anti-spamming, J Intell Fuzzy Syst, 38, 3, pp. 2765-2776, (2020); Ahmad A., Whitworth B., Bertino E., A framework for the application of socio-technical design methodology, Ethics Inf Technol, 24, 4, (2022); Alpaydin E., Introduction to machine learning, (2009); Anderson M., Hitlin P., Atkinson M., Wikipedia at 15: Millions of readers in scores of languages., (2016); Barboza F.C., Jeong H., Kobayashi K., Shiramatsu S., An ontology-based computational framework for analyzing public opinion framing in news media, 2013 IEEE Int Conf Syst Man Cybern, pp. 2420-2426, (2013); Becker D., Bendett S., Crowdsourcing solutions for disaster response: examples and lessons for the US government, Procedia Eng, 107, pp. 27-33, (2015); Boididou C., Middleton S.E., Jin Z., Papadopoulos S., Dang-Nguyen D.T., Boato G., Kompatsiaris Y., Verifying information with multimedia content on twitter: a comparative study of automated approaches, Multimed Tools Appl, 77, pp. 15545-15571, (2018); Boididou C., Papadopoulos S., Zampoglou M., Apostolidis L., Papadopoulou O., Kompatsiaris Y., Detection and visualization of misleading content on twitter, Int J Multimed Inf Retr, 7, pp. 71-86, (2018); Bordia P., DiFonzo N., When social psychology became less social: Prasad and the history of rumor research, Asian J Soc Psychol, 5, 1, pp. 49-61, (2002); Castillo C., Mendoza M., Poblete B., Information credibility on twitter, Proceedings of the 20Th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 675-684, (2011); Cen J., Li Y., A rumor detection method from social network based on deep learning in big data environment, Comput Intell Neurosci, (2022); Chen X., A real time anti-spamming system in crowdsourcing platform, Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS), 2016 7Th IEEE International Conference On, IEEE, pp. 981-984, (2016); Choudhury D., Acharjee T., A novel approach to fake news detection in social networks using genetic algorithm applying machine learning classifiers, Multimed Tools Appl, 82, pp. 9029-9045, (2023); Chua A.Y., Banerjee S., To share or not to share: the role of epistemic belief in online health rumors, Int J Med Inf, 108, pp. 36-41, (2017); Chua A.Y., Banerjee S., Rumor verifications on facebook: click speech of likes, comments and shares, 2017 Twelfth international conference on digital information management (ICDIM), pp. 257-262, (2017); Clark B.Y., Zingale N., Logan J., Brudney J., A framework for using crowdsourcing in government, Social Entrepreneurship: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, pp. 405-425, (2019); Clayton K., Blair S., Busam J.A., Forstner S., Glance J., Green G., Nyhan B., Real solutions for fake news?

Objective: We conducted a feasibility study as an initial step toward formalizing the hybrid risk assessment model by identifying high-level digital forensic artifacts that have the potential to be valid and reliable indicators of risk, with a focus on CPORT Items 5, 6, and 7. Data: Law enforcement investigators from a High Tech Crime Unit (HTCU) randomly selected seven closed cases; selection criteria included: male offender over 18, mobile device, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) offense, and 2019–2023 index offense. Investigation details related to probable cause, final charges, conviction, and offender risk were not disclosed. Statistical information (f, %) for the following digital forensics artifacts was examined: 1) pornography collection (e.g., % of media, content type, gender ratio) and 2) evidence of networking/grooming and other problematic online activities (e.g., number of native messages vs. application messages; type of installed apps). Method: The analysis predicted whether the offender was a CSAM-only or dual offender and if our findings agreed with the level of risk for reoffending suggested by CPORT Items 5, 6, and 7. Results were shared with the HTCU and scored for accuracy. Results: The hybrid model was accurate in 6 of 7 cases. Conclusion: We conclude a hybrid model is feasible, and the findings illustrate the importance of analyzing app artifacts for context. Study limitations and future research recommendations are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Child sexual abuse materials; CPORT; Digital forensic artifacts; Dual offender; Non-contact offender; Offender risk,article; artifact; child sexual abuse; clinical article; crime; digital forensics; feasibility study; female; grooming; human; law enforcement; male; offender; patient selection; pornography; risk assessment,,,,,Lafayette Police Department; HTCU,"We could not have conducted this research without the support of the Tippecanoe High Tech Crime Unit and Lafayette Police Department.

Cyberpredators commit their crimes by employing the Internet and online services-social network platforms, online groups and organizations, smart phone apps, bulletin board systems, online forums, websites, internet relay chat channels-to locate and harm victims of all ages through attacking, exploiting, humiliating, bullying, harassing, threatening, defrauding, and extorting. Cyberpredators and Their Prey describes non-sexual and sexual interpersonal crimes-online romance scam, swatting, trolling, stalking, bullying, harassment, minor sexting, sexual trafficking, child sexual abuse material, sextortion, and image-based sexual abuse offenses. Each chapter contains: crime definition and relevant issues; typical cyberpredator, motives, and methods; typical victims and behaviors that make them targets; current criminal laws for prosecuting cybercrimes and assessment of their applicability and effectiveness as deterrents; the crime’s impact on individual victims and society in general; and cybersecurity prevention and intervention strategies. Also covered are the unique challenges that the regulation, investigation, and prosecution of these cybercrimes pose to criminal justice and private security agents worldwide; the need for society to hold companies operating online responsible for their role in cybercrime; and how aspects of the online environment (i.e., anonymity, toxic disinhibition, de-individuation, inculpability) contribute to harmful and abusive interpersonal interaction, particularly when enacted by perpetrators as part of a group attack. Key features: • Portrays material through multidisciplinary lens of psychology, criminal justice, law, and security • Provides consistent, practical information about online criminals and victims • Compares online to offline versions of the same crime • Discusses adequacy of current laws for prosecuting cybercriminals • Considers elements of the online environment that foster criminal activity • Describes social engineering techniques • Considers the role of intimate partner violence in cybercrimes • Reviews 21st century skills needed to educate and protect potential targets Cyberpredators and Their Prey will prove essential reading to those who are studying to become, or are currently, security professionals; law enforcement personnel and investigators; intelligence agents; private investigators; lawyers; compliance officers; social service workers; and other professionals who deal with interpersonal cybercrime through the lens of social science. © 2023 Lauren R.

Unfortunately, the authorship of many of them remains unknown. In some channels, the problem of establishing authorship may be even harder, since the length of digital texts is limited to a certain number of characters. In this work, we aim at identifying authors of tweet messages, which are limited to 280 characters. We evaluate popular features employed traditionally in authorship attribution which capture properties of the writing style at different levels. We use for our experiments a self-captured database of 40 users, with 120 to 200 tweets per user. Results using this small set are promising, with the different features providing a classification accuracy between 92% and 98.5%. These results are competitive in comparison to existing studies which employ short texts such as tweets or SMS. © 2020 IEEE.",Authorship Attribution; Authorship Identification; Forensics; Microblogging; N-Grams; Stylometry,Forensic science; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Classification accuracy; Criminal investigation; Digital text; Microblogging; Stylometric features; Writing style; Biometrics,,,,,"Swedish Knowledge Foundation; Vetenskapsrådet, VR; European Social Fund, ESF",Author F.

This paper reviews the existing BEA approaches and process models and concludes the lack of standardisation in the BEA process. The research comprehends that existing BEA methodologies are restricted to specific characteristics of the forensic domain in question. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a standardised approach detailing the step-by-step implementation of BEA in the DF process. The proposed model presents a homogenous technique that can be practically applied to real-life cases. This standard BEA framework classifies digital evidence into categories to decipher associated offender characteristics. Unlike existing models, this new approach collects evidence from diverse sources and leaves no aspect unattended while probing criminal behavioural cues, thus facilitating its applicability across varied forensic domains. © 2021 IGI Global.

Social media providers seek for accurate and efficient way of recognizing offensive content for shielding their users. Content-based Cybercrime detection is one of the conspicuous area of data mining that deals with the recognition and examination of bully contents usually presented at social media. The current work emphasizes on cyberbullying, one of the prominent problems that arose due to the increasing fame of social network and its fast acceptance in our day-to-day survives. The social network provides a convenient platform for the cyber predators to bull their preys especially targeting young youth. In severe cases, the victims have attempted suicide due to humiliation, insult, and hostile messages left by the predators. This work presents a systematic critical study to accumulate, investigate, apprehend and explore the patterns and study gaps in a well-organized manner. The study portrays a comprehensive systematic literature review of strategies proposed in the field of content-based cybercrime. In this review, precise investigation methodology is utilized based on a total selected 27 research papers out of 51 research papers published in preeminent workshops, symposiums and conferences and conspicuous journals. The survey relates to several data preprocessing techniques, content-based feature, machine learning methodology, online social networking datasets and evaluation parameter used in context of detecting content-based cybercrime. This Methodical analysis of the research work acts as an assistant for the researchers to discover the significant characteristics of content-based Cybercrime detection techniques. © BEIESP.",Content based cybercrime;

However, most studies focus only on one platform or one of the gateways of cyber-trafficking. Thus, this paper introduces the development and comparison of the Naive Bayes Algorithm, Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models to predict trafficking and non-trafficking websites. In developing the supervised classification models, 37 keywords were used to scrape suspected trafficking websites. Thirty-five (35) websites were classified as trafficker out of 63; this data was used to create the models. Upon evaluating the accuracy rates of the models, the Naive Bayes Algorithm got ninety-one percent (91%), Logistic Regression got eighty-one percent (81%), KNN got sixty-four percent (64%), and SVM got sixty-four percent (64%). Thus, Naive Bayes can predict more accurately than the other classification algorithms. The result shows that the predictive model could be an effective tool for identifying different online platforms that are used in trafficking. Once the model is integrated into an application, this will be easier and faster for law enforcement agencies to monitor human trafficking in a fast-growing cyberspace community. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Classification algorithm; Cyber trafficking; Human trafficking; K-nearest neighbor (KNN); Logistic regression; Naïve bayes; Support vector machine,Crime; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Websites; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Cybe trafficing; Human trafficking; K-near neighbor; Logistics regressions; Naive bayes; Naive-Bayes algorithm; Nearest-neighbour; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines,,,,,,,"Definition and Scale.Learn More about Human Trafficking and How Prevalent This Fast-Growing Crime Is, (2022); Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, (2009); Trafficking in Persons Report: Philippines, (2022); Latonero M., Human Trafficking Online: The Role of Social Networking Sites and Online Classi-Fieds.

Our mix-method study, comprised of an online survey, five FGDs, and 20 semi-structured interviews in Bangladesh, investigates the common nature, location, and time of the abuse, post-incident support, and possible combating strategies. Besides revealing important facts, our findings highlight the need of decentering the design from the victims (children and/or guardians) to the community. Hence, building on the theory of transformative justice, we prototyped and evaluated 'ShishuShurokkha' - an online tool that involves the whole community by allowing anonymous bystander reporting, visualizing case-maps, connecting with legal, medical, and social support, and raising awareness. The evaluation of ShishuShurokkha shows the promise for such a communal approach toward combating child sexual abuse, and highlights the needs for sincere involvement of the government, NGOs, the legal, educational, and religious services in this. © 2022 ACM.",Bangladesh; Child Sexual abuse; Community Driven Design; Gender Harassment; Shame; ShishuShurokkha; Social Media; Solidarity; Transformative Justice,Computer programming; Bangladesh; Child sexual abuse; Community driven design; Gender harassment; Online surveys; Shame; Shishushurokkha; Social media; Solidarity; Transformative justice; Social networking (online),,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (-2018-0); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (892191082); Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI, (37608); Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, MRIS","This research was made possible by the generous grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (#RGPIN-2018-0), Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (#892191082), Canada Foundation for Innovation (#37608), Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (#37608), International Fulbright Centennial Fellowship of Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, and Facebook Fellowship of Sharifa Sultana.","Ericsson A.B., Stewards of Children Prevention Toolkit on the App Store, (2021); Abebe R., Goldner K., Mechanism design for social good, Ai Matters, 4, 3, pp. 27-34, (2018); Abras C., Maloney-Krichmar D., Preece J., Et al., User-centered design, Bainbridge, W.

This is the first in a two-part series about the PrevBOT concept, which is an automated tool supporting the police in preventing CSEA in online chat rooms. Part I presents the concept, its theoretical framework, and the technology. Equipped with technology for Authorship Analysis, the tool can identify problematic digital spaces unsafe for children. Given the advancements in machine learning algorithms, PrevBOTmay provide predictions concerning age and gender behind online aliases engaged in sexualized speech with children and assist the police in identifying former CSEA offenders who resume the criminal activity online. Part II provides a legal analysis of issues relating to data protection, privacy, and fair trial.

There are numerous techniques and algorithms that have been published so far, in the field of stylometry. In this regard, the primary objective of the present review is to provide the status of the different studies carried out on authorship analysis based on the important research contributions. The authors have mainly focused on each of the article selected for review (2010-16), by summarizing the authorship detection fields, the corpus, the features of authorship analysis, and authorship attribution techniques used which could provide a platform to distinguish between different research contributions and the diverse techniques used in classifying the author's texts. The details on common tools and authorship attribution techniques published in the recent past would be of importance to the concerned researchers as an aid towards text data mining and future growth in the study of authorship attribution. © 2017 IEEE.",authorship analysis;

Much research has been devoted to analyzing writing styles in handwritten, word-processed and online social networks (OSN) texts. Word processing editors that typically include spell and grammar checkers may influence the writing style as it allows an individual to edit a piece of text to perfection. Thus, similarities may exist between OSN and word-processed texts. Moreover, none of the studies to date have made a detailed comparison of the writing styles across multidisciplinary factors. This paper attempts to close the gap between the writing styles in pre- and post-Internet periods as well as provide an in-depth comparison of the writing styles in OSN texts across three major factors: demographics, personality behavior, and cybersecurity. The aim is to learn from past literature as we advance these techniques to OSN texts. Thus, in this paper, we also propose a novel machine learning prediction model based on tense morphology, to classify age and gender from English blogs, and the PAN 2013 dataset. This model achieves an accuracy of 94%-98% and 95%-97% for age and gender, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.",Online social networks; survey; writing styles,Classification (of information); Word processing; Author identification; Cyber security; Grammar checkers; Major factors; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSN); Prediction model; Target audience; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Moerk E.L., Quantitative analysis of writing styles, J.

Chinese text analysis requires not only statistics but also semantic comprehension analysis. Different text types need other language style feature modeling to obtain good recognition results. In this study, we use the deep learning method to construct an automatic text feature extraction model and classify it with the author as a classification label. This study presents a literature author recognition model based on deep learning, which is mainly divided into three phases: text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Each part consists of several small modules or steps. First, we input the corpus to Word2Vec to generate the new word vector. Then, the improved text feature extractor based on CNN and Attention extracts the text features and uses them as the input of the CNN convolution layer. After convolution, the text is combined with bits to get Window Feature Sequence. It is the text feature vector. Next, based on LSTM and Softmax classification output, Window Feature Sequence is used as the input of LSTM to obtain two one-dimensional vectors spliced by concatenate layer. Finally, the result is classified through the fully connected layer, Batch Normalization layer, and Softmax. The performance of the proposed model in recognizing authors of Chinese literature was evaluated using two datasets. In the research process, the data we collected included works of different forms, such as prose and fiction. The research results show that the proposed model can effectively identify author identity. The classification accuracy of our proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of the benchmark model. © 2024 The Author",Attentional mechanisms; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Long-and short-term memory network (LSTM); Text analysis,,,,,,TF-IDF,"Zhao Y. et al. used 365 function words as text features to identify the authors of Associated Press (AP) Newswire articles in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) corpus of AP. The experiment proved that function words play a good role in describing the authors of articles and are an important text feature [14]. Yu B. explored the role of function words in the corpus of Chinese literary works of nine authors in three periods and three styles, and tested the effect of 35 Chinese function words as stylistic features through three sets of Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering experiments, and came to the following conclusions: Chinese function words can be used as stylistic features for genre identification and author identification, but they have no significant time sensitivity and are basically independent of time period [15]. Ma Jianbin et al. used lexical Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and structural features as stylistic feature sets, and used support vector machine algorithm to conduct experiments on the corpus of blogs, BBS and E-mail, and concluded that: A higher accuracy can be obtained by combining linguistic features and structural features, but the effect of the two features is not obvious when used alone. Single-layer feature extraction cannot meet the needs of accuracy of author identification, and only multi-layer feature extraction can better obtain text features [16]. Hassan F H. et al. tested the N-grams of the first character, middle character and end character of text words, and the experiment proved that only the first character bi-gram and tri-gram could effectively identify the author [17]. Goebel R. used DepWords coding instead of syntactic dependency to identify authors of detective novels, and the experiment achieved a high accuracy [18].YÜLÜCE and DALKILIÇ conducted an experiment for identification of authors in Turkish language texts using machine learning techniques. They have used TF-IDF features for extracting the features of each document. Then, several classifiers such as: Ensemble learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) were examined for author identification. Their results, showed the superiority of SGD over other classifiers [24].","Yale G.U., On sentence length as a statistical characteristic of style in prose with application to two cases of disputed authorship [J], Biometrika, 30, pp. 363-390, (1938); Gani J., Literature and atatisticsfM]//Kotz SJonhnson N L.Encyclo— Pedia of Statistics, pp. 90-95, (1985); Valenza R.J., Are the Thisted-Efron authorship tests valid?, JJCom- puter and the Humanities, 25, pp. 27-46, (1991); Khmelev D., Tweedy F.J., Using Markov chains for identification of writers[J], Lit.

With Minecraft being so popular, particularly with younger audiences, it is no surprise that the interactive nature of Minecraft has facilitated the commission of criminal activities such as denial of service attacks against gamers, cyberbullying, swatting, sexual communication, and online child grooming. In this research, there is a simulated scenario of a typical Minecraft setting, using a Linux Ubuntu 16.04.3 machine (acting as the MMOG server) and Windows client devices running Minecraft.

Evidently, current research is primarily focused on its technological development. However, involving adolescents' voices regarding the desirability of this monitoring is important; particularly because automatic monitoring might invade adolescents' privacy and freedom, and consequently evoke reactance. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N = 66) between 12 and 18 years old. The goal was to obtain insights into adolescents' opinions on desirability and priorities for automatically detecting harmful content on SNSs. Opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of freedom. Most adolescents in this study are in favour of automatic monitoring for situations they perceive as uncontrollable or that they cannot solve themselves. Clear priorities for detection must be set in order to ensure the privacy and autonomy of adolescents. Moreover, monitoring actions aiming at the prevention of harm are required. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Adolescents; Automatic monitoring; Online protection; Qualitative research; Social networking sites,,,,,,"Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology; Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie, IWT, (120007)",This work was supported by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) under Grant 120007 .  ,"Angelides S., Technology, hormones, and stupidity"": The affective politics of teenage sexting, Sexualities, 16, 5-6, pp. 665-689, (2013); Bandura A., Barbaranelli C., Caprara G., Pastorelli C., Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, 2, pp. 364-374, (1996); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd workshop on computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); boyd D., Friendship, Hanging out, messing around, geeking out: Living and learning with new media, pp. 79-115, (2009); boyd D., It's complicated: The social lives of networked teens, (2014); Brehm K., A theory of psychological reactance, (1966); Byrne S., Lee T., Toward predicting youth resistance to internet risk prevention strategies, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 55, 1, pp. 90-113, (2011); Cano A., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, SociInfo 2014.

This study presents a method for recognizing human emotions using LogNNet neural network and keystroke dynamics dataset. Two types of training sets were investigated, with 10 and 15 features compiled on the basis of the Emosurv database, an assessment of recognition metrics was given (accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1). It is shown that the accuracy of recognition of one emotion out of 5 (happy, sad, angry, calm, neutral state) reaches 33.4% when using 10 features read only from the keyboard. Such a neural network can be placed on 'Internet of Things' edge devices with low computing resources and RAM up to 3 kB, as well as built into the keyboard using inexpensive controllers such as Arduino. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Doria 6, Catania, 95125, Italy","Internet can be misused by cyber criminals as a platform to conduct illegitimate activities (such as harassment, cyber bullying, and incitement of hate or violence) anonymously. As a result, authorship analysis of anonymous texts in Internet (such as emails, forum comments) has attracted significant attention in the digital forensic and text mining communities. The main problem is a large number of possible of authors, which hinders the effective identification of a true author. We interpret open class author attribution as a process of expert recommendation where the decision support system returns a list of suspected authors for further analysis by forensics experts rather than a single prediction result, thus reducing the scale of the problem. We describe the task formally and present algorithms for constructing the suspected author list. For evaluation we propose using a simple Winner-Takes-All (WTA) metric as well as a set of gain-discount model based metrics from the information retrieval domain (mean reciprocal rank, discounted cumulative gain and rank-biased precision). We also propose the List Precision (LP) metric as an extension of WTA for evaluating the usability of the suspected author list. For experiments, we use our own dataset of Internet comments in Lithuanian language and consider the use of language-specific (Lithuanian) lexical features together with general lexical features derived from English language. For classification we use one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results of experiments show that the usability of open class author attribution can be improved considerably by using a set of language-specific lexical features together with general lexical features, while the proposed method can be used to reduce the number of suspected authors thus alleviating the work of forensic linguists. © 2017 PTI.",,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Digital forensics; Information systems; Internet; Support vector machines; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Expert recommendations; Information retrieval domain; Internet comments; Mean reciprocal ranks; One-class classifier; One-class support vector machine; Taxonomies,,,,,"Programme EC DG Home Affairs ISEC; European Commission, EC","The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the project “Lithuanian Cybercrime Centre of Excellence for Training, Research & Education” (L3CE) project, Grant Agreement No. HOME/2013/ISEC/AG/INT/4000005176), financed by European Commission under the Programme EC DG Home Affairs ISEC (Prevention of and against crime 2007-2013).","Irons A., Lallie H.S., Digital forensics to intelligent forensics, Future Internet, 6, pp. 584-596, (2014); Chaski C.E., Author identification in the forensic setting, The Oxford Handbook of Forensic Linguistics, (2012); Iqbal F., Binsalleeh H., Fung B.C.M., Debbabi M., A unified data mining solution for authorship analysis in anonymous textual communications, Inf.

Build upon the previous studies, we extend the seminal theory of reasoned action (TRA) in this research, through the adoption of an salient but understudied construct, user role, which captures user inclination toward providing or seeking social support, and further explore how it impacts OHC users’ self-disclosure intention. We adopt a mixed methods approach including manual coding, machine learning algorithms, and econometric analyses, and investigate over 4 million posts over 17 years from a well-developed breast cancer OHC to uncover both direct and indirect effects of user role on OHC users’ intention of future self-disclosure intention. The results reveal both the main and moderating effects of user roles regarding users’ self-disclosure intention. First, user with a more clear intention of social support seeking or providing are more likely to disclose personal information. Second, the relative tendency of support provision magnifies the positive effects of attitudinal and normative factors toward future disclosure. We also discuss the findings and implications of the extended TRA framework to generate some actionable insights of OHC design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Online health communities; Self-disclosure; Social support exchange; Theory of reasoned action (TRA),,,,,,"City University of Hong Kong, (7200645); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72104261, 72201221); Central University of Finance and Economics, CUFE",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72104261 and Grant 72201221; Central University of Finance and Economics under the Program for Innovation Research; City University of Hong Kong under Faculty Start-Up Grant 7200645. ,"Oh S., Syn S.Y., Motivations for sharing information and social support in social media: a comparative analysis of Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, You tube, and Flickr, J Assoc Inf Sci Technol, 66, 10, pp. 2045-2060, (2015); Fox S., The Social Life of Health Information, (2014); Rideout V., Fox S., Digital health practices, social media use, and mental well-being among teens and young adults in the U.S, A National Survey Sponsored by Hopelab and Well Being Trust, (2018); Liu Q.B., Liu X., Guo X., The effects of participating in a physician-driven online health community in managing chronic disease: evidence from two natural experiments, MIS Q, 44, 1, pp. 391-419, (2020); Wang L., Yan L., Zhou T., Guo X., Heim G.R., Understanding physicians’ online-offline behavior dynamics: an empirical study, Inf Syst Res, 31, 2, pp. 537-555, (2020); Huang K.Y., Chengalur-Smith I., Pinsonneault A., Sharing is caring: social support provision and companionship activities in healthcare virtual support communities, MIS Q, 43, 2, pp. 395-424, (2019); Acquisti A., Brandimarte L., Loewenstein G., Privacy and human behavior in the age of information, Science, 347, 6221, pp. 509-514, (2015); Bol N., Dienlin T., Kruikemeier S., Sax M., Boerman S.C., Strycharz J., Helberger N., de Vreese C.H., Understanding the effects of personalization as a privacy calculus: analyzing self-disclosure across health, news, and commerce contexts †, J Comput Mediat Commun, 23, 6, pp. 370-388, (2018); Cavusoglu H., Phan T.Q., Cavusoglu H., Airoldi E.M., Assessing the impact of granular privacy controls on content sharing and disclosure on Facebook, Inf Syst Res, 27, 4, pp. 848-879, (2016); Barak A., Boniel-Nissim M., Suler J., Fostering empowerment in online support groups, Comput Hum Behav, 24, 5, pp. 1867-1883, (2008); Lieberman M., The role of insightful disclosure in outcomes for women in peer-directed breast cancer groups: a replication study, Psycho-Oncology, 16, 10, (2007); Wang X., Zhao K., Street N., Analyzing and predicting user participations in online health communities: a social support perspective, J Med Internet Res, 19, 4, (2017); Wang Y.-C., Kraut R., Levine J.M., To stay or leave?

This requires the potentially computational model for law enforcement authorities to facilitate a detection of human trafficking activities. The machine learning (ML) models have been used to detect these activities mostly rely on text classification and often omit the correction of misspelled words, resulting in the risk of predictions error. Therefore, an improvement data processing approach is one of strategies to enhance an efficiency of human trafficking detection. This paper presents a novel approach to solving spelling mistakes. The approach is designed to select misspelled words, the replace them with the popular words having the same meaning based on an estimation of the probability of words and context used in human trafficking advertisements. The applicability of the proposed approach was demonstrated with the labeled human trafficking dataset using three classification models: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The achievement of higher accuracy of the model predictions using the proposed method evidences an improved alert on human trafficking outperforming than the others. The proposed approach shows the potential applicability to other datasets and domains from the online advertisements. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

People keep numerous identities on various online social sites. User-related network data has distinctive information which shows user interests, behavioral patterns, and political views. By using these behaviors individually and collectively are of great help to recognize users across social networks. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) has been performed to distinguish 31 papers published during 2010–2018. The idea is to determine user identification categories that are used to classify users. Furthermore, to identify algorithms, models, methods, and tools that has been suggested since 2010 for user characterization. We have identified 10 algorithms, 19 models, 5 methods and 8 tools that have proposed for 5 user identification categories. Finally, we empirically evaluated that text mining techniques are promising approaches for the identification of users on online social networks. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Online social networks;

XPUAs are able to bypass the existing app vetting procedures leveraging their unique technical characteristics and make revenue on addicitive contents that are strictly prohibited by either local laws or app market regulations. In this paper, we first examined the profit chain of XPUAs and then proposed PUAXray, a novel detection system that utilized machine learning to identify XPUAs. PUAXray used a binary classifier that was trained on features extracted from cross-platform payloads, including semantics information and third-party library usage information. We evaluated PUAXray on a dataset that was created for the first time in the community with benign apps from reputable app markets and XPUAs from an industry collaborator. PUAXray achieved 95.4% F1-score in the XPUAs identification task, and proved capable to be extended to other cross-platform UI frameworks. © 2023 IEEE.",Cross-platform UI Framework; Malware Detection; Potentially Unwanted App; Profit Chain,Classification (of information); Commerce; Laws and legislation; Malware; Semantics; Cross-platform; Cross-platform UI framework; Detection system; Local laws; Malware detection; Market regulation; Platform payloads; Potentially unwanted app; Profit chain; Specific languages; Profitability,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62132013); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC",ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 62132013.,"Ahmad Z., Ozkaya U., Machine learning and artificial intelligencebased child abusing tracking system for the detection of online sexual predators, International Conference on Trends in Advanced Research, 1, pp. 131-141, (2023); Allix K., Bissyande T.F., Klein J., Le Traon Y., Androzoo: Collecting millions of android apps for the research community, Proceedings of the 13th international conference on mining software repositories, pp. 468-471, (2016); Andow B., Nadkarni A., Bassett B., Enck W., Xie T., A study of grayware on google play, 2016 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW).

While users are able to access information and share knowledge with unprecedented ease and openness, danger also lurks in the dark. Social networks have the potential to draw unwanted and anomalous attention to their users. Through online social networks, the daily routines of an individual may be under constant surveillance of others. Such risks are closely associated with information leakage, and have posed serious privacy and safety concerns. This paper investigates such risks, which are typically captured by excessive, unprecedented and persistent gathering of personal information through the cyberspace. We focus on ways to mitigate such risks through formalizing the concepts of anomalous attention. This is a challenging question, as such behaviors are usually victim-defined and often occurs without visible trace. Viewing a network as interconnected nodes who exchange information through posting and reading messages, we provide an abstract model of attention, and quantify the level of attention a user pays towards another. Analyzing the sequence of attention between pairs of users in the network allow one to capture anomalous activities. © 2017 IEEE.",,Information dissemination; User profile; Virtual reality; Abstract modeling; Cyberspaces; Daily routines; Information leakage; Interconnected nodes; Models of attention; Personal information; Privacy concerns; Safety concerns; Share knowledge; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Liu J., Moskvina A., Hierarchies, ties and power in organizational networks: Model and analysis, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 6, 1, (2016); Moskvina A., Liu J., How to Build Your Network? a Structural Analysis, (2016); Togetherness: An algorithmic approach to network integration, Ieee/acm International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, pp. 223-230, (2016); Integrating networks of equipotent nodes, International Conference on Computational Social Networks, pp. 39-50, (2016); Yan B., Chen Y., Liu J., Dynamic Relationship Building: Exploitation Versus Exploration on a Social Network, pp. 75-90, (2017); Joinson A., Looking at', 'looking up' or 'keeping up with' people?

The activation functions often suffer from 'gradient vanishing', 'non zero-centred function outputs', 'exploding gradients', and 'dead neurons', which may lead to deterioration in the classification performance. This paper proposes an activation function generation approach using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang inference in an effort to address such challenges. In addition, the proposed method further optimises the coefficients in the activation function using the genetic algorithm such that the activation function can adapt to different applications. This approach has been applied to a digital forensics application of online grooming detection. The evaluations confirm the superiority of the proposed activation function for online grooming detection using an unbalanced data set. © 2019 IEEE.",,Chemical activation; Deterioration; Digital forensics; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Activation functions; Adaptive activation function; Classification performance; Dead neurons; Forensic applications; Function generation; Fuzzy inferencer; Neural-networks; Takagi-sugeno; Text categorization; Fuzzy inference,,,,,,,"Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, Proc.

Engaging interactions, such as likes, shares, and replies, between users are the key determinants of these platforms’ news feed prioritization algorithms. These interactions attract people to ongoing debates and help inform and shape their opinions. Since being influential and attracting followers in these debates are considered as important, understanding the automation of these processes becomes critical in order to contribute positively. In this work, we aim to train a chatbot system that classifies tweets according to their positions, and it can also generate tweets related to a conversation. In this study, we test our system on a recently popular topic, namely the gun control debate in the U.S. Chatbots, are trained to tweet independently for their side and also reply meaningfully to a tweet from the opposite side. State-of-the-art architectures are tested to obtain a more accurate classification. We applied GloVe embedding model for representing tweets. Instead of using handcrafted features, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is applied to these embeddings to get more informative and equal-sized feature vectors. This model is trained to encode a tweet as a sequence of embeddings. Encoding is used for both message classification and generation tasks. LSTM sequence-to-sequence model is used to generate topical tweets and replies to tweets. We develop a new salience metric for measuring the relatedness of a generated message to a target tweet. Additionally, human evaluations are performed to measure the quality of the chatbot generated tweets according to their topic relevance and bias, and the quality of its replies to target tweets. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Natural language processing; Recurrent neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Tweet classification; Tweet generation; Twitter bot,Embeddings; Encoding (symbols); Network architecture; Quality control; Social networking (online); Feature vectors; Human evaluation; Key determinants; Micro-blogging platforms; Prioritization; Sequence modeling; State of the art; Topic relevance; Long short-term memory,,,,,,,"Adiwardana D., Luong M.-T., So D.R., Hall J., Fiedel N., Thoppilan R., Yang Z., Kulshreshtha A., Nemade G., Lu Y., Towards a Human-Like Open-Domain Chatbot, (2020); Antipov G., Baccouche M., Dugelay J., Face aging with conditional generative adversarial networks, 2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2017, (2017); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate, 3Rd International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2015, Conference Track Proceedings, (2015); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation, J Mach Learn Res, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching word vectors with subword information, Trans Assoc Comput Linguist, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Bradesko L., Mladenic D., A survey of Chatbot systems through a Loebner prize competition, Proceedings of Slovenian Language Technologies Society Eighth Conference of Language Technologies, pp. 34-37, (2012); Brandtzaeg P.B., Folstad A., Chatbots: changing user needs and motivations, Interactions, 25, 5, pp. 38-43, (2018); Brixey J., Hoegen R., Lan W., Rusow J., Singla K., Yin X., Artstein R., Leuski A., Shihbot: A facebook chatbot for sexual health information on HIV/AIDS, Proceedings of the 18Th Annual Sigdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, Saarbrücken, Germany, August 15–17, 2017, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 370-373, (2017); Chavoshi N., Hamooni H., Mueen A., Identifying correlated bots in twitter, Social informatics—8th International Conference, Proceedings, Part II, Volume of 10047 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 14-21, (2016); Chen H., Liu X., Yin D., Tang J., A survey on dialogue systems: recent advances and new frontiers, SIGKDD Explor, 19, 2, pp. 25-35, (2017); Chen C., Mu S., Xiao W., Ye Z., Wu L., Ju Q., Improving image captioning with conditional generative adversarial nets, The Thirty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2019, the Thirty-First Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference, pp. 8142-8150, (2019); Chollampatt S., Ng H.T., A multilayer convolutional encoder-decoder neural network for grammatical error correction, Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Cho K., van Merrienboer B., Bahdanau D., Bengio Y., On the properties of neural machine translation: Encoder-decoder approaches, Proceedings of SSST@EMNLP 2014, Eighth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation, pp. 103-111, (2014); Cui R., Agrawal G., Ramnath R., Tweets can tell: activity recognition using hybrid gated recurrent neural networks, Soc Netw Anal Min, 10, 1, pp. 1-15, (2020); Cui L., Huang S., Wei F., Tan C., Duan C., Zhou M., Superagent: A customer service chatbot for e-commerce websites, Proceedings of the 55Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 97-102, (2017); Demirel B., Cinbis R.G., Ikizler-Cinbis N., Image captioning with unseen objects, 30Th British Machine Vision Conference, (2019); Denkowski M.J., Lavie A., Meteor 1.3: Automatic metric for reliable optimization and evaluation of machine translation systems, Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, WMT@EMNLP 2011, pp. 85-91, (2011); Dumais S.T., Furnas G.W., Landauer T.K., Deerwester S., Harshman R., Using latent semantic analysis to improve access to textual information, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 281-285, (1988); Ebrahimi M., Automatic Identification of Online Predators in Chat Logs by Anomaly Detection and Deep Learning, (2016); Ertugrul A.M., Karagoz P., Movie genre classification from plot summaries using bidirectional LSTM, 12Th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, ICSC 2018, pp. 248-251, (2018); Ertugrul A.M., Velioglu B., Karagoz P., Word Embedding Based Event Detection on Social Media.

Cyberbullying, which is a kind of cybercrime, is defined as an aggressive, intentional action against a defenseless person by using the Internet, social media, or other electronic contents. Researchers have found that many of the bullying cases have tragically ended in suicides; hence automatic detection of cyberbullying has become important. The aim of this study is to detect cyberbullying on social media messages written in Turkish. To our knowledge, this is the first study which makes cyberbully detection on Turkish texts. We prepare a dataset from Instagram and Twitter messages written in Turkish and then we applied machine learning techniques that are Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision tree (C4.5), Naïve Bayes Multinomial, and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers to detect cyberbullying. We also apply information gain and chi-square feature selection methods to improve the accuracy of classifiers. We observe that when both words and emoticons in the text messages are taken into account as features, cyberbully detection improves. Among the classifiers, Naïve Bayes Multinomial is the most successful one in terms both classification accuracy and running time. When feature selection is applied classification accuracy improves up to 84% for the dataset used. © 2017 IEEE.",Cyberbullying; Social media; Text classification; Turkish texts,Classification (of information);

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Digital forensics is the science of detecting evidence from digital media like a computer, smart phone, server, or network. It provides the forensic team with the most beneficial methods to solve confused digital-related cases. AI and blockchain can be applied to solve online predatory chat cases and photo forensics cases, provide network service evidence, custody of digital files in forensic medicine, and identify roots of data scavenging. The increased use of PCs and extensive use of internet access, has meant easy availability of hacking tools. Over the past two decades, improvements in the information technology landscape have made the collection, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence extremely important. The traditional tools for solving cybercrimes and preparing court cases are making investigations difficult. We can use AI and blockchain design frameworks to make the digital forensic process efficient and straightforward. AI features help determine the contents of a picture, detect spam email messages and recognize swatches of hard drives that could contain suspicious files. Blockchain-based lawful evidence management schemes can supervise the entire evidence flow of all of the court data. This book can provide a wide-ranging overview of how AI and blockchain can be used to solve problems in digital forensics using advanced tools and applications available on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,River Publishers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Irrelevance,3 Automatic Identification of Cyber Predators Using Text Analytics and Machine Learning,,Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in Digital Forensics,,2022.0,41.0,54.0,9788770226875.0,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9933574.pdf&bkn=9933495&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,31 Oct 2022,,,River eBook Chapters
