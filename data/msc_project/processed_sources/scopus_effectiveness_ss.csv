At its core, Protectbot incorporates DialoGPT, a conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) model rooted in Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) technology, engineered to simulate human-like interactions within gaming chat rooms. The framework is distinguished by a robust text classification strategy, rigorously trained on the Publicly Available Natural 2012 (PAN12) dataset, aimed at identifying and mitigating potential sexual predatory behaviors through chat conversation analysis. By utilizing fastText for word embeddings to vectorize sentences, we have refined a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, achieving remarkable performance metrics, with recall, accuracy, and F-scores approaching 0.99. These metrics not only demonstrate the classifier’s effectiveness, but also signify a significant advancement beyond existing methodologies in this field. The efficacy of our framework is additionally validated on a custom dataset, composed of 71 predatory chat logs from the Perverted Justice website, further establishing the reliability and robustness of our classifier. Protectbot represents a crucial innovation in enhancing child safety within online gaming communities, providing a proactive, AI-enhanced solution to detect and address predatory threats promptly. Our findings highlight the immense potential of AI-driven interventions to create safer digital spaces for young users. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; chatbot technology; child online safety; generative pre-trained transformer (GPT); machine learning; online gaming; predatory behavior detection","Classification (of information); E-learning; Online systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Behavior detection; Chatbot technology; Chatbots; Child online safety; Children online; Generative pre-trained transformer; Machine-learning; On-line gaming; Predatory behavior; Predatory behavior detection; Support vector machines","","","","","Academic Research Committee of Rochester Institute of Technology","This research was funded by the Academic Research Committee of Rochester Institute of Technology, Dubai.","Faraz A., Mounsef J., Raza A., Willis S., Child Safety and Protection in the Online Gaming Ecosystem, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 115895-115913, (2022); Stalker P., Livingstone S., Kardefelt-Winthe D., Saeed M., Growing up in a Connected World, (2019); Helbing D., Brockmann D., Chadefaux T., Donnay K., Blanke U., Woolley-Meza O., Moussaid M., Johansson A., Krause J., Schutte S., Et al., Saving Human Lives: What Complexity Science and Information Systems can Contribute, J.

While efforts to address the issue of sexual exploitation of children may be slow, the capabilities of offenders to organize, communicate over the internet, and harness technology are unequivocally fast. Protection of children against cyber exploitation has become imperative, and measures should be taken that are specific and targeted to provide specialized victim identification capabilities; adequate protection for children using the internet; genuine participation of children; a full and responsible private sector and finally, coordinated, effective, and structured international cooperation to protect all children. Combating the Exploitation of Children in Cyberspace: Emerging Research and Opportunities provides innovative research for understanding all elements of combating cyber exploitation of children including the roles of law enforcement, international organizations, and the judicial system and educating children and their families to the dangers of the independent internet usage through cyberspace awareness programs. The content within this publication examines child grooming, cyberbullying, and cybercrime. It is designed for law enforcement, lawmakers, teachers, government officials, policymakers, IT specialists, cybercriminal researchers, psychologists, victim advocates, professionals, academicians, researchers, and students. © 2021 by IGI Global.

With the rise of cybercrimes targeting children, chat-logs can be used to discover and flag harmful behaviour for the attention of law enforcement units. This can make an important contribution to the safety of minors on SMPs from being exploited by online predators. The problem is that digital forensic investigation is mostly manual. Thus, a daunting task for forensic investigators because of the sheer volume and variety of data. The solution that is proposed in this paper employs a Digital Forensic Process Model that is supported by Machine Learning (ML) methods to facilitate the automatic discovery of harmful conversations in chat-logs. ML has already been successfully applied in the domain of text analysis for the discovery of online sexual predatory chats. However, there is an absence of approaches that show how ML can contribute to a digital forensic investigation. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to indicate how the tasks in a digital forensic investigation process can be organised so to obtain useable ML results when investigating online predators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber safety; Cybersecurity; Digital forensic investigation; Machine learning; Online sexual predatory conversation","Computer crime; E-learning; Electronic crime countermeasures; Machine learning; Automatic discovery; Chat logs; Cyber-crimes; Forensic investigation; Forensic process models; Social media platforms; Text analysis; Digital forensics","","","","","","","Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2009); Amato F., Castiglione A., De Santo A., Moscato V., Picariello A., Persia F., Sperli G., Recognizing human behaviours in online social networks, Comput.

Social engineering is one of them that addresses the multidisciplinary challenges of cyber security. Nowadays, the attacks associated with social engineering are diverse, including the so-called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These have been the subject of numerous investigations; however, cybernetic attacks of similar nature as grooming have been excluded from these studies. In the last decade, various efforts have been made to understand the structure and approach of grooming from the field of computer science with the use of computational learning algorithms. Nevertheless, these studies are not aligned with information security. In this work, the study of grooming is formalized as a social engineering attack, contrasting its stages or phases with life cycles associated with APTs. To achieve this goal, we use a database of real cyber-pedophile chats; this information was refined and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to determine the stages of the attack. Once the number of stages was determined, we proceed to give them a linguistic context, and with the use of machine learning, a linear model was trained to obtain 97.6% of training accuracy.

In this paper, we describe the novel application of a deep learning method to the automatic identification of predatory chat conversations in large volumes of chat logs. We present a classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address this problem domain. The proposed CNN architecture outperforms other classification techniques that are common in this domain including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and regular Neural Network (NN) in terms of classification performance, which is measured by F1-score. In addition, our experiments show that using existing pre-trained word vectors are not suitable for this specific domain. Furthermore, since the learning algorithm runs in a massively parallel environment (i.e., general-purpose GPU), the approach can benefit a large number of computation units (neurons) compared to when CPU is used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CNNs are adapted and applied to this application domain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Language model; Online predator identification; Predatory conversation; Support vector machine; Word embedding","Automation; Convolution; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Program processors; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Language model; Predatory conversation; Word embedding; Support vector machines","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (N00009)","This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ( N00009 ).

In this regard, online sex crimes are among the principal ones to prevent, especially those where a child is abused. The paper at hand proposes C3-Sex, a smart chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with suspects in order to profile their interest regarding online child sexual abuse. This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation. The ACE is designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies that constitute the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and calculate a set of 25 features that describes the suspect’s behavior. After 50 days of experiments, the chatbot generated a dataset with 7199 profiling vectors with the features associated to each suspect. Afterward, we applied an unsupervised method to describe the results that differentiate three groups, which we categorize as indifferent, interested, and pervert. Exhaustive analysis is conducted to validate the applicability and advantages of our solution. © 2020 by the authors.

Earlier studies have majorly employed machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting such conversations. Since deep learning frameworks have shown significant improvements in various text classification tasks, therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based classifier for detecting predatory conversations. Furthermore, instead of designing the system from the beginning, transfer learning has been proposed where the potential of the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is utilized to solve the predator detection problem. BERT is mostly used to encode the textual information of a document into its context-aware mathematical representation. The inclusion of this pre-trained model solves two major problems, i.e. feature extraction and Out of Vocabulary (OOV) terms. The proposed system comprises two components: a pre-trained BERT model and a feed-forward neural network. To design the classification system with a pre-trained BERT model, two approaches (feature-based and fine-tuning) have been used. Based on these approaches two solutions are proposed, namely, BERT_frozen and BERT_tuned where the latter approach is seen performing better than the existing classifiers in terms of F1 and F0.5 -scores. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","BERT; Child grooming; Deep learning; Language modelling; Online sexual predators","Classification (of information); Deep learning; E-learning; Feedforward neural networks; Modeling languages; Text processing; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Child grooming; Deep learning; Language model; Learning approach; Netizen; Online sexual predator; Social media; Transfer learning; Transformer modeling; Support vector machines","","","","","European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, ERCIM","The work was supported by the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) Alain Bensoussan Fellowship Program.","Rise in Online Child Sexual Abuse Cases Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic, (2021); Online Grooming of Children for Sexual Purposes: Model Legislation & Global Review.

Of particular concern are interactions between minors and adults with predatory intentions. Unfortunately, previous research on online sexual grooming has relied on time-intensive manual annotation by domain experts, limiting both the scale and scope of possible interventions. This work explores the possibility of detecting predatory behaviours with accuracy comparable to expert annotators using machine learning (ML). Using a dataset of 6771 chat messages sent by child sex offenders, labelled by two of the authors who are forensic psychology experts, we study how well can deep learning algorithms identify eleven known predatory behaviours. We find that the best-performing ML models are consistent but not on par with expert annotation. We therefore consider a system where an expert annotator validates the ML algorithms outputs. The combination of human decision-making and computer efficiency yields precision - but not recall - comparable to manual annotation, while taking only a fraction of the time needed by a human annotator. Our findings underscore the promise of ML as a tool for assisting researchers in this area, but also highlight the current limitations in reliably detecting online sexual exploitation using ML.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","chat logs; Child sexual exploitation; machine learning; natural language processing; online grooming","Decision making; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Chat logs; Child sexual exploitation; Communication strategy; Language processing; Machine-learning; Manual annotation; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online grooming; Predatory behavior; Learning algorithms","","","","","Leverhulme Centre, (RC-2015-067); University of Liverpool, UoL, (9972)","Funding text 1: Given the nature of our topic, ethical approval was sought for the initial data collection and manual labelling of the Perverted Justice corpus.

Due to rapid and unstoppable technological progress, multiplying opportunities and pushing the boundaries of digital technology and the Internet, the interest of the state and institutions within the state is to raise digital competencies of citizens, with special emphasis on children and youth as the most vulnerable groups of Internet users. The age limit and frequency of use of the Internet by young generations has been moved back a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the concern for information security of young people is increasingly emphasized. If, and to what extent, knowledge of the issue of identification and authentication affects the information security of high school students aged 16 to 19 in the virtual space, the research question addressed by the authors of this paper was to determine which student behaviors pose a potential danger compromising their information security by establishing a correlation between the variables that determine student behavior and the variables used to examine their level of security in a virtual environment. The research was conducted using a questionnaire on a sample of high school students in the Republic of Croatia, the results of which showed that some students practice behaviors that are potentially dangerous, make them vulnerable and easy targets of cyber predators and attackers, which is why there is cause for concern and a need for a additional education of children of primary and secondary school age in the field of information security in the form of the introduction of the subject Digital Literacy. Based on the results, a model for assessing the level of digital literacy of adolescents that affect information literacy can be designed, but also further related research in the field of information literacy of children and youth can be conducted. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

There are numerous techniques and algorithms that have been published so far, in the field of stylometry. In this regard, the primary objective of the present review is to provide the status of the different studies carried out on authorship analysis based on the important research contributions. The authors have mainly focused on each of the article selected for review (2010-16), by summarizing the authorship detection fields, the corpus, the features of authorship analysis, and authorship attribution techniques used which could provide a platform to distinguish between different research contributions and the diverse techniques used in classifying the author's texts. The details on common tools and authorship attribution techniques published in the recent past would be of importance to the concerned researchers as an aid towards text data mining and future growth in the study of authorship attribution. © 2017 IEEE.","authorship analysis;

The text argues that a safeguarding dystopia results in docile children, rather than safe ones, and that we should stop seeing technology as the sole solution to online safeguarding. The reader will, through reading this book, gain a deeper understanding of the current policy arena in online safeguarding, what causes children to beocme upset online, and the doomed nature of safeguarding solutions. The book also features a detailed analysis of issues surrounding content filtering, access monitoring, surveillance, image recognition, and tracking.

Social biometric focuses on extracting the pattern a user exhibits while interacting and communicating through social networks. The paper addresses the online sexual predator problem by mining the vocabulary and emotional behavior, which could assist in identifying if the user is a benign or predator. The feature-set consists of vocabulary terms that appear differently in predator and victim content. In order to strengthen the detection model, the paper also focuses on distinguishing the two classes of users based on emotions reflected in their conversation. The experiments are performed on the PAN 2012 corpus. Two datasets are created with respect to vocabulary-based and emotion-based features. The results obtained on the test set have proved that by integrating the vocabulary and emotion-based attributes, the performance of the system is significantly enhanced. While comparing, the proposed approach has outperformed top existing methods by obtaining F1, F2, and F0.5values of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.96 respectively. Furthermore, we also recorded the best accuracy compared to state-of-the-art studies for our proposed SBB-based approach with 99.86%, 99.51%, and 99.88% for Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

It is of great need to be able to detect extreme criminal behaviours on the World-Wide Web and take measures to protect the general public from the effects of such behaviours. The aim of this chapter is to examine the current data analysis tools and technologies that are used to detect extreme online criminal behaviour and the challenges that exist associated with the use of these technologies. Specific emphasis is given to extreme criminal behaviours such as paedophilia and serial killing as these are considered the most dangerous behaviours. A number of conclusions are drawn in relation to the use and challenges of technological means in order to face such criminal behaviours. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Akerkar R., Big data computing, (2014); Almond L., McManus M.A., Chatterton H., Internet Facilitated Rape: A Multivariate Model of Offense Behavior, Journal of Interpersonal Violence, pp. 1-26, (2017); Rapist who used Facebook, Tinder and Snapchat to prey on 14 teenage girls is sentenced to 30 years in prison, (2018); Bleakley P., Watching the watchers: Taskforce Argos and the evidentiary issues involved with infiltrating Dark Web child exploitation networks, The Police Journal: Theory, Practice and Principles, pp. 1-16, (2018); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Information, Communication & Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Brewer J., Dealing With Psychopaths in the Internet Age, (2018); Broadhurst R., Grabosky P., Alazab M., Bouhours B., Chon S., An analysis of the nature of groups engaged in cyber crime, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 8, 1, pp. 1-20, (2014); Cano Basave A., Fern'andez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, SociInfo 2014: The 6th International Conference on Social Informatics, (2014); Chen F., Deng P., Wan J., Zhang D., Vasilakos A.V., Rong X., Data Mining for the Internet of Things: Literature Review and Challenges, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2015, (2015); Corriveau P., Greco C., Online Paedophilia and Cyberspace, (2018); Craker N., March E., The dark side of Facebook®: The Dark Tetrad, negative social potency, and trolling behaviours, Personality and Individual Differences, 102, pp. 79-84, (2016); Davies C., Sadistic' paedophile Matthew Falder jailed for 32 years, The Guardian, (2018); Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database Research Project, (2018); French L., Virtual Case Notes: Raped Through Internet - Swedish Man Convicted in Unprecedented Case, (2017); Galan-Garcia P., de la Puerta J.G., Gomez C.L., Santos I., Bringas P.G., Supervised Machine Learning for the Detection of Troll Profiles in Twitter Social Network: Application to a Real Case of Cyberbullying, International Joint Conference SOCO'13-CISIS'13-ICEUTE'13.

People keep numerous identities on various online social sites. User-related network data has distinctive information which shows user interests, behavioral patterns, and political views. By using these behaviors individually and collectively are of great help to recognize users across social networks. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) has been performed to distinguish 31 papers published during 2010–2018. The idea is to determine user identification categories that are used to classify users. Furthermore, to identify algorithms, models, methods, and tools that has been suggested since 2010 for user characterization. We have identified 10 algorithms, 19 models, 5 methods and 8 tools that have proposed for 5 user identification categories. Finally, we empirically evaluated that text mining techniques are promising approaches for the identification of users on online social networks. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Online social networks;

We all either enjoy it, struggle with it, or may have been victims of it. Sexuality is not just about sex, but about human sexual function, the physiology of sex, the hormones involved and how they affect us, and the cultural norms related to it. Sexual function and dysfunction are closely tied to one’s self-esteem, self-respect, and to relationships with intimate partners. Human Sexuality: Function, Dysfunction, Paraphilias, and Relationships, explores the interplay of intimacy and sexuality; how it can enhance relationships, and how it can negatively affect them, or be affected by them. When individuals or partners encounter sexual problems or dysfunctions it can have a long-lasting affect both biologically and psychologically. Dr. Rokach explores the causes and the reasons that these dysfunctions are maintained, and successful treatment methods. Chapters on sexual offenses and paraphilias and what treatment options are available to sexual offenders are also included. This book is the first book to place sexuality where it belongs, within the context of relationships demonstrating how sexuality relates to intimacy by both enhancing and negatively affecting it. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The aims of the research are: (1) delineate between grooming behaviour, predatory behaviour, and offending behaviour; (2) differentiate between passive and controlling solicitor language; (3) disentangle these behaviours from what the technology permits; (4) extend the current understanding of cybersexual abuse to show grooming as only one aspect of a phenomenon that also includes predation and offence; and (5) identify how these results are important for academics and software developers. © Operational Research Society 2020.","child sexual abuse; grounded theory; Mike Gallivan; online sexual predation; Pär Ågerfalk; Social media; social media theory","Information systems; Grounded theory; Instant messaging; Software developer; Theoretical foundations; Unintended consequences; Online systems","","","","","","","Akdeniz Y., (2016); Aljazzaf Z.M., Perry M., Capretz M.A., Online trust: Definition and principles, 2010 Fifth International Multi-conference on Computing in the Global Information Technology, Valencia, pp. 163-168, (2010); al-Khateeb H.M., Epiphaniou G., How technology can mitigate and counteract cyber-stalking and online grooming, Computer Fraud & Security, 2016, 1, pp. 14-18, (2016); Berson I.R., Grooming cybervictims: The psychosocial effects of online exploitation for youth, Scientific American, 2, 1, pp. 9-19, (2003); Birks D.F., Fernandez W., Levina N., Nasirin S., Grounded theory method in information systems research: Its nature, diversity and opportunities, European Journal of Information Systems, 22, 1, pp. 1-8, (2013); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring high-level features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); The Economist, (2016); Briggs P., Simon W.T., Simonsen S., pp. 72-91, (2011); Brown A., Relationships, community, and identity in the new virtual society, The Futurist, 45, 2, (2011); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Cheong Y.G., Jensen A.K., Gudnadottir E.R., Bae B.C., Togelius J., Detecting predatory behavior in game chats, IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, 7, 3, pp. 220-232, (2015); Chiesa A., Goldson E., Child sexual abuse, Pediatrics in Review, 38, 3, pp. 105-118, (2017); Chiluwa I., Social media networks and the discourse of resistance: A sociolinguistic CDA of Biafra online discourses, Discourse & Society, 23, 3, pp. 217-244, (2012); Choo K.R., Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences (Vol. 103).

While strides have been made regarding the computational facets of algorithms for “real-time” risk detection, such research has not yet evaluated these advancements through a human-centered lens. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 53 peer-reviewed articles on real-time risk detection on social media. Real-time detection was mainly operationalized as “early” detection after-the-fact based on pre-defined chunks of data and evaluated based on standard performance metrics, such as timeliness. We identified several human-centered opportunities for advancing current algorithms, such as integrating human insight in feature selection, algorithms' improvement considering human behavior, and utilizing human evaluations. This work serves as a critical call-to-action for the HCI and ML communities to work together to protect social media users before, during, and after exposure to risks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)","Human-Centered Machine Learning; Literature Review; Online Risk; Real-Time Risk Detection; Social Media","Behavioral research; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Human-centered machine learning; Literature reviews; Machine-learning; Online risk; Real- time; Real-time risk detection; Research agenda; Risk detections; Social media; Social media platforms; E-learning","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (-2329976, -2333207, -1942610); National Science Foundation, NSF; William T.

A sexual predator is defined as a person who tries to obtain sexual favors in a predatory manner, usually with underage people. The proposed approach uses several text categorization methods and empirical behavioral features developed especially for the task at hand. After investigating various approaches for solving the sexual predator identification problem, we have found that a two-stage classifier achieves the best results. In the first stage, we employ a Support Vector Machine classifier to distinguish conversations having suspicious content from safe online discussions. This is useful as most chat conversations in real life do not contain a sexual predator, therefore it can be viewed as a filtering phase that enables the actual detection of predators to be done only for suspicious chats that contain a sexual predator with a very high degree. In the second stage, we detect which of the users in a suspicious discussion is an actual predator using a Random Forest classifier. The system was tested on the corpus provided by the PAN 2012 workshop organizers and the results are encouraging because, as far as we know, our solution outperforms all previous approaches developed for solving this task. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","","Decision trees;

This paper examines this question in the light of the “language of nature” and of Aristotelian causal analysis, in particular the concept of means and ends. Thus, it is possible to point out the root of the distinction between the identity of the person and the entity of any technology. Nature indicates that the person is always an end in itself. Technology, on the contrary, should only be a means to serve the person. The diversity of their respective natures also explains why their respective agencies enjoy diverse scopes. Technological operations (artificial agency, artificial intelligence) find their meaning in the results obtained through them (poiesis). Moreover, the person is capable of actions whose purpose is precisely the action itself (praxis), in which personal agency and, ultimately, the person themselves, is irreplaceable. Forgetting the distinction between what, by nature, is an end and what can only be a means is equivalent to losing sight of the instrumental nature of AI and, therefore, its specific meaning: the greatest good of the patient. It is concluded that the language of nature serves as a filter that supports the effective subordination of the use of AI to its specific purpose, the human good. The greatest contribution of this work is to draw attention to the nature of the person and technology, and about their respective agencies. In other words: listening to the language of nature, and attending to the diverse nature of the person and technology, personal agency, and artificial agency. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; ethics; language of nature; patient care","artificial intelligence; health care; language; public health; Article; artificial intelligence; biodiversity; comprehension; decision making; decision support system; health care; health care personnel; health legislation; human; human rights; interpersonal communication; language; medical ethics; orientation; patient care; patient education; social subordination; technology","","","","","","","Ageing and Health, (2022); Bajwa J., Munir U., Nori A., Williams B., Artificial intelligence in healthcare: Transforming the practice of medicine, Future Healthc.

Most prior linguistic and psychological research into online sexual abuse analyses transcripts involving adult decoys posing as children. In contrast, our data comprise genuine online conversations between the offender and 20 victims. Using move analysis (Swales 1981, 1990), we explore the offender’s numerous presented personas. The offender’s use of rhetorical moves is investigated, as is the extent to which the frequency and structure of these moves contribute to and discriminate between the various online personas he adopts. We find from eight frequently adopted personas that two divergent identity positions emerge: the sexual pursuer/aggressor, performed by the majority of his online personas, and the friend/boyfriend, performed by a single persona. Analysis of the offender’s self-describing assertives suggests this distinctive persona shares most attributes with the offender’s ‘home identity’. This article importantly raises the question of whether move analysis might be useful in identifying the ‘offline persona’ in cases where offenders are known to operate multiple online personas in the pursuit of child victims. © Oxford University Press 2018.","","","","","","","","","Acar K.V., Sexual extortion of children in cyberspace, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 10, pp. 110-126, (2016); Bhatia V.K., Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, (1993); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behaviour in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse and Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Boon A., Identifying moves in an IMCD session, Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University, 21, pp. 219-235, (2013); Boon A., Learner Support and Discovery in A Virtual Non-Judgmental Environment, (2015); Bucholtz M., Why be normal?

Assistance in prioritizing cases of sexual exploitation of potentially risky conversations is crucial. While attempts to automatically triage conversations for the risk of sexual exploitation of minors have been attempted in the past, most computational models use features which are not representative of the grooming process that is used by investigators. Accurately annotating an offender corpus for use with machine learning algorithms is difficult because the stages of the grooming process feed into one another and are non-linear. In this paper we propose a method for labeling risk, tied to stages and themes of the grooming process, using fuzzy sets. We develop a neural network model that uses these fuzzy membership functions of each line in a chat as input and predict the risk of interaction. © 2019 IEEE.","","Fuzzy neural networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Membership functions; Computational model; Fuzzy membership function; Neural network model; Non linear; Risk perception","","","","","Purdue Research Foundation","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was partially supported by Purdue Research Foundation.","Online Enticement of Children: An In-Depth Analysis of CyberTipLine Reports, (2017); Whittle H.C., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A.R., Victimsfffdfffdfffd voices: The impact of online grooming and sexual abuse, Universal Journal of Psychology, 1, 2, pp. 59-71, (2013); Chiu M.M., Seigfried-Spellar K.C., Ringenberg T.R., Exploring detection of contact vs. fantasy online sexual offenders in chats with minors: Statistical discourse analysis of self-disclosure and emotion words, Child Abuse & Neglect, 81, pp. 128-138, (2018); Connell R.O., A Typology of Child Cybersexploitation and Online Grooming Practices, (2003); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse & Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Babchishin K.M., Hanson R.K., VanZuylen H., Online child pornography offenders are different: A meta-analysis of the characteristics of online and offline sex offenders against children, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44, 1, pp. 45-66, (2015); Parapar J., Losada D.E., Barreiro A., A learning-based approach for the identification of sexual predators in chat logs, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Barber C., Bettez S., Deconstructing the Online Grooming of Youth: Toward Improved Information Systems for Detection of Online Sexual Predators, (2014); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring highlevel features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); Bayerl P.S., Paul K.I., What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations.

A number of approaches have been proposed to analyze the content of the messages to identify predatory conversations. However, due to the non-availability of large-scale predatory data, the state-of-the-art works employ a standard dataset that has less than 10% predatory conversations. Dealing with such heavy class imbalance is a challenge to devise reliable predatory detection approaches. We present a new approach for dealing with class imbalance using a hybrid sampling and class re-distribution to obtain an augmented dataset. To further improve the diversity of classifiers and features in the ensembles, we also propose to perturb the data along with augmentation in an iterative manner. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate an improvement of 3% over the best state-of-the-art approach and results in an F1-score of 0.99 and an Fβ of 0.94 from the proposed approach.  © 2021 IEEE.","Imbalanced dataset; Online Conversation; Predatory Detection; Sampling","Art work; Class imbalance; Detection approach; Imbalanced dataset; Large-scales; New approaches; Online platforms; Predatory detection; Re-distribution; State of the art; Large dataset","","","","","","","Bentley H., O'Hagan O., Raff A., Bhatti I., How safe are our children, The Most Comprehensive Overview of Child Protection in the UK, (2016); Craven S., Brown S., Gilchrist E., Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature and theoretical considerations, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 12, 3, pp. 287-299, (2006); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF (Online Working Notes/labs/workshop), 30, (2012); Latapy M., Magnien C., Fournier R., Quantifying paedophile queries in a large p2p system, 2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM.

Several existing approaches analyze a limited amount of information stemming from the interactions of the child with the corresponding online party. Some restrict access to websites based on a blacklist of known forbidden URLs, others attempt to parse and analyze the exchanged multimedia content between the two parties. However, new URLs can be used to circumvent a blacklist, and images, video, and text can individually appear to be safe, but need to be judged jointly. We propose a highly modular framework of analyzing content in its final form at the user interface, or Human Computer Interaction (HCI) layer, as it appears before the child: on the screen and through the speakers. Our approach is to produce Children's Agents for Secure and Privacy Enhanced Reaction (CASPER), which analyzes screen captures and audio signals in real time in order to make a decision based on all of the information at its disposal, with limited hardware capabilities. We employ a collection of deep learning techniques for image, audio and text processing in order to categorize visual content as pornographic or neutral, and textual content as cyberbullying or neutral. We additionally contribute a custom dataset that offers a wide spectrum of objectionable content for evaluation and training purposes. CASPER demonstrates an average accuracy of 88% and an F1 score of 0.85 when classifying text, and an accuracy of 95% when classifying pornography.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cyber-bullying; cyber-grooming; online safety; pornography filter; real time agent","Computer hardware; Deep learning; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer systems; Media streaming; Online systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; User interfaces; Amount of information; Cybe-grooming; Cyber bullying; Features extraction; Hardware; Online safety; Pornography filter; Real - Time system; Real time agents; Streaming medium; Real time systems","","","","","European Commission, EC, (825618); European Commission, EC","This work was supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through Next Generation Internet (NGI) Trust under Grant 825618.","AlDahoul N., Karim H., Abdullah M., Fauzi M., Wazir A., Mansor S., See J., Transfer detection of YOLO to focus CNN's attention on nude regions for adult content detection, Symmetry, 13, 1, (2020); Bochkovskiy A., (2019); Avila S., Thome N., Cord M., Valle E., De Araujo A.A., Pooling in image representation: The visual codeword point of view, Comput.

Unfortunately, text length is limited on some platforms, making the challenge harder. We aim at identifying the authorship of Twitter messages limited to 140 characters. We evaluate popular stylometric features, widely used in literary analysis, and specific Twitter features like URLs, hashtags, replies or quotes. We use two databases with 93 and 3957 authors, respectively. We test varying sized author sets and varying amounts of training/test texts per author. Performance is further improved by feature combination via automatic selection. With a large amount of training Tweets (>500), a good accuracy (Rank-5>80%) is achievable with only a few dozens of test Tweets, even with several thousands of authors. With smaller sample sizes (10-20 training Tweets), the search space can be diminished by 9-15% while keeping a high chance that the correct author is retrieved among the candidates. In such cases, automatic attribution can provide significant time savings to experts in suspect search. For completeness, we report verification results. With few training/test Tweets, the EER is above 20-25%, which is reduced to <15% if hundreds of training Tweets are available. We also quantify the computational complexity and time permanence of the employed features.  © 2019 IEEE.","Authorship identification; biometrics; social media forensics; stylometry; writer identification; writer verification","Digital forensics; Automatic selection; Feature combination; Literary analysis; Microblogging; Search spaces; Stylometric features; Verification results; Writer identification; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Nirkhi S., Dharaskar R.V., Comparative study of authorship identification techniques for cyber forensics analysis, Int.

This encourages people with malevolent intentions to take advantage of trustful youngsters by means of various internet-based messaging platforms and subsequently inflicting harm to people below the legal age if a physical meeting is arranged. While previous research has prioritized the automatic identification of online solicitors by means of analyzing online chat conversations, little work has been done in terms of studying the conversational features of chats involving fantasy-driven and contact-driven online solicitors. This study focuses on 271 conversations extracted from Perverted-Justice, an online repository of chats between a predator and a volunteer pretending to be underage and presents results from training a model to triage between fantasy and contact-driven online solicitors. © 2019 IEEE.","Online Predator Identification, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing","Automation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Robotics; Automatic identification; Internet based; NAtural language processing; Online repositories; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Sweetie 2. 0: Stop Webcam Childsex, (2018); Chiu M.M., Seigfried-Spellar K.C., Ringenberg T.R., Exploring detection of contact vs fantasy online sexual offenders in chats with minors: Statistical discourse analysis of self-disclosure and emotion words, Child Abuse & Neglect, 81, pp. 128-138, (2018); Seigfried-Spellar K., Ringenberg T., Chiu M., Rogers M., Distinguishing contact child sex offenders vs non-contact solicitors: Toward a digital forensics tool for automatic analysis of their chats with minors, The LEIU/IALEIA Annual Training Conference in Bloomington, (2017); Online Enticement of Children: An In-Depth Analysis of CyberTipLine Reports, (2017); Kloess J.A., Beech A.R., Harkins L., Online child sexual exploitation: Prevalence, process, and offender characteristics, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse, 15, 2, pp. 126-139, (2014); Whittle H.C., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A.R., Victims voices: The impact of online grooming and sexual abuse, Universal Journal of Psychology, (2013); Webster S., Davidson J., Bifulco A., Gottschalk P., Caretti V., Pham T., Grove-Hills J., Turley C., Tompkins C., Ciulla S., Et al., European online grooming project final report, European Commission Safer Internet Plus Programme, (2012); Mitchell K.J., Jones L.M., Finkelhor D., Wolak J., Trends in Unwanted Online Experiences and Sexting : Final Report; Merdian H.L., Moghaddam N., Boer D.P., Wilson N., Thakker J., Curtis C., Dawson D., Fantasy-driven versus contact-driven users of child sexual exploitation material: Offender classification and implications for their risk assessment, Sexual Abuse, 30, 3, pp. 230-253, (2018); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, (2011); Gupta A., Kumaraguru P., Sureka A., Characterizing Pedophile Conversations on the Internet Using Online Grooming, (2012); Drouin M., Boyd R.L., Hancock J.T., James A., Linguistic analysis of chat transcripts from child predator undercover sex stings, The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology, 28, 4, pp. 437-457, (2017); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse & Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Cano Basave A., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting Child Grooming Behaviour Patterns on Social Media, 8851, (2014); Morris C., Hirst G., Identifying sexual predators by SVM classification with lexical and behavioral features, CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), 12, (2012); Eriksson G., Karlgren J., Features for modelling characteristics of conversations: Notebook for pan at CLEF, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, (2012); Popescu M., Grozea C., Kernel methods and string kernels for authorship analysis notebook for pan at CLEF, Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, (2012); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montesy Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), (2012); Stuart L.M., Tazhibayeva S., Wagoner A.R., Taylor J.M., On identifying authors with style, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pp. 3048-3053, (2013); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring high-level features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop in Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis.

This book expands the lens of Cyberpsychology to consider how digital experiences play out across the various stages of people's lives. Most psychological research has focused on whether human-technology interactions are a 'good' or a 'bad' thing for humanity. This book offers a distinctive approach to the emergent area of Cyberpsychology, moving beyond these binary dilemmas and considering how popular technologies have come to frame human experience and relationships. In particular the authors explore the role of significant life stages in defining the evolving purpose of digital technologies. They discuss how people's symbiotic relationship with digital technologies has started to redefine our childhoods, how we experience ourselves, how we make friends, our experience of being alone, how we have sex and form romantic relationships, our capacity for being antisocial as well as the experience of growing older and dying. This interdisciplinary book will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners across psychology, digital technology and media studies as well as anyone interested in how technology influences our behaviour. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

No aspect of life is left untouched and in the world of crime, especially grooming crimes, which target victims who are children, are also experiencing considerable increase. Legal limitations make it difficult for law enforcement officials to carry out more effective law enforcement. This study examines the legal regime and the factors that encourage crime against children. The present research will be an important point of departure as it will influence the work process of law enforcement officers in terms of child care, especially for child victims. This study uses a legal normative method with a qualitative case study approach, a conceptual approach and a legislative approach. The results show that legal arrangements regarding grooming crimes are regulated using different laws, but do not clearly and explicitly address the many important issues around grooming crimes. As a result, law enforcement officials have difficulty interpreting laws in relation to the relevant causal factors, such as the perpetrator, the victim and social factors. © (2023).

Prior work has sought to automatically identify grooming chats, but only after an incidence has already happened in the context of legal prosecution. In this work, we instead investigate this problem from the point of view of prevention. We define and study the task of early sexual predator detection (eSPD) in chats, where the goal is to analyze a running chat from its beginning and predict grooming attempts as early and as accurately as possible. We survey existing datasets and their limitations regarding eSPD, and create a new dataset called PANC for more realistic evaluations. We present strong baselines built on BERT that also reach state-of-the-art results for conventional SPD. Finally, we consider coping with limited computational resources, as real-life applications require eSPD on mobile devices. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Computational resources;

It is therefore essential to have effective IT tools that automate the detection and blocking of this type of material, as manual filtering of huge volumes of data is practically impossible. The goal of this study is to carry out a comprehensive review of different learning strategies for the detection of sensitive content available in the literature, from the most conventional techniques to the most cutting-edge deep learning algorithms, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each, as well as the datasets used. The performance and scalability of the different strategies proposed in this work depend on the heterogeneity of the dataset, the feature extraction techniques (hashes, visual, audio, etc.) and the learning algorithms. Finally, new lines of research in sensitive-content detection are presented. © 2023 by the authors.","deep learning; digital forensics; image recognition; sensitive content; sexually explicit content detection; video classification","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101021801); European Commission, EC","This work was supported by the HEROES project (http://heroes-fct.eu, accessed on 4 February 2023).

In this scenario, the issue of online faked identities is more and more present, with the phenomena of identity alteration, identity theft and identity fraud. To date, there are no systems able to detect people who subscribe or authenticate an online service with faked personal information. Moreover, the existing validated lie detection techniques are not suitable to be applied in the online environment. Starting from a previous study, this paper investigates the possibility to detect faked identities recording keystroke dynamics, while the user is filling an online subscription form with personal – real or faked, information. Cognitively overloading liars through few unexpected questions, we demonstrated that it is possible to recognize the deceivers with an accuracy of 85%. To automatically detect liars, three machine-learning classifiers were trained on 40 liars and 40 truth-tellers, and tested on 10 unseen liars and 10 truth-tellers. Liars have proved to be distinguishable from truth-tellers as they make more errors and are slower in typing unexpected information about their identity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Faked identity; Identity verification; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detection; Online identity","Crime; Dynamics; Learning systems; Faked identity; Identity verification; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detection; Online identity; Online systems","","","","","","","Internet Usage Statistics; Gross R., Acquisti A., Information revelation and privacy in online social networks, Proceedings of the 2005 ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, pp. 71-80, (2005); Siibak A., Casanova’s of the virtual world.

Sixty participants were assigned to an honest (n = 30) or deceptive group (n = 30). The deceptive group was instructed to memorize the false biographical details of a fictitious identity. Throughout the interviews, participants were presented with a randomized sequence of control, expected, and unexpected open-ended questions about identity. Responses were audio recorded for detailed examination. Our findings indicate that deceptive participants showed markedly longer latencies and higher error rates when answering expected (requiring deception) and unexpected questions (for which premeditated deception was not possible). Longer response latencies were also observed in participants attempting deception when answering control questions (which necessitated truthful answers). Moreover, a within-subject analysis highlighted that responding to unexpected questions significantly impaired individuals’ performance compared to answering control and expected questions. Leveraging machine-learning algorithms, our approach attained a classification accuracy of 98% in distinguishing deceptive and honest participants. Additionally, a classification analysis on single response levels was conducted. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of merging response latency metrics and error rates with unexpected questioning as a robust method for identity deception detection in investigative interviews. We also discuss significant implications for enhancing interview strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Adult; Deception; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Lie Detection; Machine Learning; Male; Reaction Time; Young Adult; adult; analytical error; article; benchmarking; controlled study; deception; female; human; human experiment; interview; latent period; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; normal human; reaction time; young adult; deception; interview; lie detection; physiology; psychology","","","","","","","Verschuere B., Ben-Shakhar G., Meijer E., Memory Detection: Theory and Application of the Concealed Information Test, (2011); Sartori G., Agosta S., Zogmaister C., Ferrara S.D., Castiello U., How to accurately detect autobiographical events, Psychol.

Apart from the data generated across digital devices and the use of diverse technology that slows down the traditional digital forensic investigation strategies. Dynamically scrutinizing the concealed or sparse metadata matches from the less frequent archives of evidence spread across heterogeneous sources and finding their association with other artifacts across the collection is still a horrendous task for the investigators. The effort of this article via unique pockets (UP), unique groups (UG), and unique association (UA) model is to address the exclusive challenges mixed up in identifying incoherent associations that are buried well within the meager metadata field-value pairs.

This increase in popularity has also heightened safety concerns, as virtual sexual assault against children and the youth is on the rise. The issue of sexual abuse in the metaverse is becoming increasingly controversial due to the gaps in the current regulatory framework that result from the uncertain consequences of such virtual crimes. Drawing on an online survey of female users of Zepeto (n = 343), a metaverse social network platform where users interact with others while creating personalized avatars and virtual spaces, this study aims to explore how female users interpret the risk of sexual harassment in Zepeto, examining the triggers of emotional distress and behavioral change that result from such risk assessments by users. It investigates how these interpretations and responses vary depending on their sense of presence and engagement in the virtual environment and identification with their avatars and how all these processes differ between adolescent and adult female users. Overall, this study provides insights into the complex dynamics of virtual victimization. The findings could inform the development of regulatory frameworks that protect users from virtual sexual assault and create a safer environment for all users, especially the youngest generations.

Social media providers seek for accurate and efficient way of recognizing offensive content for shielding their users. Content-based Cybercrime detection is one of the conspicuous area of data mining that deals with the recognition and examination of bully contents usually presented at social media. The current work emphasizes on cyberbullying, one of the prominent problems that arose due to the increasing fame of social network and its fast acceptance in our day-to-day survives. The social network provides a convenient platform for the cyber predators to bull their preys especially targeting young youth. In severe cases, the victims have attempted suicide due to humiliation, insult, and hostile messages left by the predators. This work presents a systematic critical study to accumulate, investigate, apprehend and explore the patterns and study gaps in a well-organized manner. The study portrays a comprehensive systematic literature review of strategies proposed in the field of content-based cybercrime. In this review, precise investigation methodology is utilized based on a total selected 27 research papers out of 51 research papers published in preeminent workshops, symposiums and conferences and conspicuous journals. The survey relates to several data preprocessing techniques, content-based feature, machine learning methodology, online social networking datasets and evaluation parameter used in context of detecting content-based cybercrime. This Methodical analysis of the research work acts as an assistant for the researchers to discover the significant characteristics of content-based Cybercrime detection techniques. © BEIESP.","Content based cybercrime;

Online grooming detection requires a deep knowledge of predatory behaviour where an online conversation's positive or negative connotations rely on the context where it can change rapidly in an online chat. Therefore, it is essential to use robust feature vectors for predatory conversation detection. This research paper proposes a contrastive learning framework for feature extraction in a sentence-based manner where it can assign a feature vector to the conversation with misspellings using subword information. Also, it is vital to have a high detection rate of true positives to avoid potential non-wanted consequences. We propose a configuration of RoBERTa encoders and supervised SimCSE for training the SVM model, leading to a high rate of detecting relevant samples (predatory samples). Our proposed approach gains an F0.5-score of 0.96, an F1-score of 0.96, and an accuracy of 0.99 for predatory conversation detection that benchmarks the state-of-the-art. In order to improve the performance, we also perform experiments with various fusion approaches, where the sum fusion of all configurations obtains an accuracy of 0.99, an F_1-score of 0.97, and an F0.5-score of 0.98.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","bert;

The existing data-driven approaches usually face the challenges of lack of training data and the uncertainty of classes in terms of the classification or decision boundary. This paper proposes a grooming detection approach in an effort to address such uncertainty based on a data set derived from a publicly available profiling data set. In particular, the approach firstly applies the conventional text feature extraction approach in identifying the most significant words in the data set. This is followed by the application of a fuzzy-rough feature selection approach in reducing the high dimensions of the selected words for fast processing, which at the same time addressing the uncertainty of class boundaries. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting child grooming. © 2018 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Digital forensics; Fuzzy systems; Learning systems; Text processing; Data-driven approach; Decision boundary; Detection approach; Fast Processing; High dimensions; Intensive research; Machine learning communities; Text classification; Feature extraction","","","","","","","Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Foc C., Kalkan G., Barnardo's Online Grooming Survey 2016, (2016); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, 2011 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869, (2011); Lillis D., Becker B.A., O'Sullivan T., Scanlon M., Current challenges and future research areas for digital forensic investigation, Annual ADFSL Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law, (2016); Gunawan F.E., Ashianti L., Candra S., Soewito B., Detecting online child grooming conversation, 2016 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), pp. 1-6, (2016); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Salton G., Developments in automatic text retrieval, Science, 253, 5023, pp. 974-980, (1991); Michalski R.S., Carbonell J.G., Mitchell T.M., Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach, (2013); Yang L., Shen Q., Closed form fuzzy interpolation, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 225, pp. 1-22, (2013); Li J., Yang L., Qu Y., Sexton G., An extended takagi-sugeno-kang inference system (tsk+) with fuzzy interpolation and its rule base generation, Soft Computing, 22, 10, pp. 3155-3170, (2018); Yang L., Chao F., Shen Q., Generalized adaptive fuzzy rule interpolation, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 25, 4, pp. 839-853, (2017); Qu Y., Rong Y., Deng A., Yang L., Associated multi-label fuzzy-rough feature selection, 2017 Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (IFSA-SCIS), pp. 1-6, (2017); Mac Parthalain N., Jensen R., Fuzzy-rough feature selection using flock of starlings optimisation, Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), 2015 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-8, (2015); Jensen R., Shen Q., New approaches to fuzzy-rough feature selection, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 17, 4, pp. 824-838, (2009); Mac Parthalain N., Jensen R., Shen Q., Zwiggelaar R., Fuzzy-rough approaches for mammographic risk analysis, Intell.

It describes the CSAM ecosystem, focusing on the ways in which it is produced, distributed and consumed and explores different interventions that can be used to tackle each issue. Eliminating Online Child Sexual Abuse Material provides a methodical approach to unpacking and understanding this growing problem, identifies approaches that have been shown to work and offers alternatives that might be tried. This analysis is set within a crime science context that draws on rational choice, routine activities, situation crime prevention and environmental criminology to better understand the nature of the problem and the potential ways in which it may be solved. This book is intended for policymakers and practitioners working in child protection, online harms and related areas and for students studying sexual violence or internet-related crime. The book will also be of interest to crime scientists as it provides another example of how the approach can be used to understand and reduce crime. © 2023 Rick Brown.

Since that the behaviour are not easily identified prior to the abuse, this study gathers and collect information about child sexual abuse by pedophile and propose a comprehensive decision support system to educate children base on knowledge-driven method about online grooming by molesters. An interactive system is built to provide knowledge to children regarding child sexual abuse and pedophile in terms of definition and each characteristics of it.

Due to increased caseloads, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) researchers are developing triage tools to help law enforcement officers (LEOs) identify potential enticement conversations. However, the datasets most readily available consist of Internet sting data where an officer or vigilante, known as a decoy, imitates a minor while talking to a potential solicitor. Psychology researchers note motivations of decoys and LEOs differ from those of at-risk minors and thus the conversations are likely incongruent. Previous research in the area is limited. Existing studies either do not include all three dataset types (victim, decoy, and LEOs) or examine usage of grooming stages and grooming strategies by each group, but not how these constructs intermingle. We extend the literature by examining the usage and sequencing of grooming stages in a chat, and the use of grooming strategies in grooming stages for all three groups. We find the greatest differences in the flow of grooming conversations with decoys, victims, and LEOs exist within the risk assessment, meeting, and sexual stages. Implications for LEOs, ML and NLP researchers are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Child sexual abuse; Computer-assisted crime; Online grooming","Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems;

The study also explores whether teens’ short-term coping responses serve to mitigate PTSD or, instead, act as a response to stress from online events. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilized a web-based diary design over the course of two months. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling with repeated measures. Findings: The study confirmed that explicit content exposure, cyberbullying and sexual solicitations (but not information breaches) evoke symptoms of PTSD. Analyses also indicated that teens engage in active and communicative coping after they experience post-traumatic stress, regardless of risk type or frequency. Practical implications: The authors found that teens took active measures to cope with online risks soon after they felt threatened (within a week). Actively coping with stressful situations has been shown to enhance adolescent resilience and reduce long-term negative effects of risk exposure. If these early coping behaviors can be detected, social media platforms may be able to embed effective interventions to support healthy coping processes that can further protect teens against long-term harm from exposure to online risks. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine situational PTSD symptoms related to four types of adolescent online risk exposure within the week exposure occurred. By applying two competing theoretical frameworks (the adolescent resilience framework and transactional theory of stress), the authors show empirical evidence that suggests short-term coping responses are likely a stress reaction to PTSD, not a protective factor against it. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coping; Cyberbullying; Online privacy; Online safety; Online sexual solicitation; Post-traumatic stress disorder","","","","","","US National Science Foundation, (CNS-1018302)","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation under Grant CNS-1018302.

Detecting these risks with as much anticipation as possible is crucial for prevention. However, much research so far has focused on forensic tools that can be applied only when an attack has been performed. This paper proposes a novel and effective methodology for the early detection of threats in written social media. The goal is to recognize a potential attack before it is consummated, and using a minimum amount of information. The proposed approach considers the use of profile-based representations (PBRs) for this goal. PBRs have multiple benefits, including non-sparsity, low dimensionality, and a proved discriminative power. Moreover, representations for partial documents can be derived naturally with PBRs, which makes them suitable for the addressed problem. Results include empirical evidence on the usefulness of PBRs in the early recognition setting for two tasks in which anticipation is critical: sexual predator detection and aggressive text identification. These results reveal, on the one hand, that PBRs achieve state of the art performance when using full-length documents (i.e., the classical task), and, on the other hand, that the proposed methodology outperforms previous work on early recognition of sexual predators by a considerable margin, while obtaining state of the art performance in aggressive text identification. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported on early recognition for the approached problems. We foresee this work will pave the way for the development of novel methodologies for the problem and will motivate further research from the intelligent systems and text mining communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aggressive text identification; Deception detection; Profile-based representations; Sexual predator detection","Data mining; Intelligent systems; Amount of information; Deception detection; Detection of deceptions; Discriminative power; Low dimensionality; Profile-based representations; State-of-the-art performance; Text identification; Character recognition","","","","","Red Temática CONACYT en Tecnologías del Lenguaje, (260178, 271622); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (CB-2014-241306, CB-2015-1-258588, PDCPN2014-01-247870); Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, UANL","This work was supported by CONACYT under project grants CB-2014-241306, PDCPN2014-01-247870 and CB-2015-1-258588.

Chinese text analysis requires not only statistics but also semantic comprehension analysis. Different text types need other language style feature modeling to obtain good recognition results. In this study, we use the deep learning method to construct an automatic text feature extraction model and classify it with the author as a classification label. This study presents a literature author recognition model based on deep learning, which is mainly divided into three phases: text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Each part consists of several small modules or steps. First, we input the corpus to Word2Vec to generate the new word vector. Then, the improved text feature extractor based on CNN and Attention extracts the text features and uses them as the input of the CNN convolution layer. After convolution, the text is combined with bits to get Window Feature Sequence. It is the text feature vector. Next, based on LSTM and Softmax classification output, Window Feature Sequence is used as the input of LSTM to obtain two one-dimensional vectors spliced by concatenate layer. Finally, the result is classified through the fully connected layer, Batch Normalization layer, and Softmax. The performance of the proposed model in recognizing authors of Chinese literature was evaluated using two datasets. In the research process, the data we collected included works of different forms, such as prose and fiction. The research results show that the proposed model can effectively identify author identity. The classification accuracy of our proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of the benchmark model. © 2024 The Author","Attentional mechanisms; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Long-and short-term memory network (LSTM); Text analysis","","","","","","TF-IDF","Zhao Y. et al. used 365 function words as text features to identify the authors of Associated Press (AP) Newswire articles in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) corpus of AP. The experiment proved that function words play a good role in describing the authors of articles and are an important text feature [14]. Yu B. explored the role of function words in the corpus of Chinese literary works of nine authors in three periods and three styles, and tested the effect of 35 Chinese function words as stylistic features through three sets of Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering experiments, and came to the following conclusions: Chinese function words can be used as stylistic features for genre identification and author identification, but they have no significant time sensitivity and are basically independent of time period [15]. Ma Jianbin et al. used lexical Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and structural features as stylistic feature sets, and used support vector machine algorithm to conduct experiments on the corpus of blogs, BBS and E-mail, and concluded that: A higher accuracy can be obtained by combining linguistic features and structural features, but the effect of the two features is not obvious when used alone. Single-layer feature extraction cannot meet the needs of accuracy of author identification, and only multi-layer feature extraction can better obtain text features [16]. Hassan F H. et al. tested the N-grams of the first character, middle character and end character of text words, and the experiment proved that only the first character bi-gram and tri-gram could effectively identify the author [17]. Goebel R. used DepWords coding instead of syntactic dependency to identify authors of detective novels, and the experiment achieved a high accuracy [18].YÜLÜCE and DALKILIÇ conducted an experiment for identification of authors in Turkish language texts using machine learning techniques. They have used TF-IDF features for extracting the features of each document. Then, several classifiers such as: Ensemble learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) were examined for author identification. Their results, showed the superiority of SGD over other classifiers [24].","Yale G.U., On sentence length as a statistical characteristic of style in prose with application to two cases of disputed authorship [J], Biometrika, 30, pp. 363-390, (1938); Gani J., Literature and atatisticsfM]//Kotz SJonhnson N L.Encyclo— Pedia of Statistics, pp. 90-95, (1985); Valenza R.J., Are the Thisted-Efron authorship tests valid?, JJCom- puter and the Humanities, 25, pp. 27-46, (1991); Khmelev D., Tweedy F.J., Using Markov chains for identification of writers[J], Lit.

Many early research works have applied the footprints left by online predators to investigate online grooming. While digital forensics tools provide security to online users, it also encounters some critical challenges, such as privacy issues and the lack of data for research in this field. Our literature review investigates all research papers on grooming detection in online conversations by looking at the psychological definitions and aspects of grooming. We study the psychological theories behind the grooming characteristics used by machine learning models that have led to predatory stage detection. Our survey broadly considers the authorship profiling research works used for grooming detection in online conversations, along with predatory conversation detection and predatory identification approaches. Various approaches for online grooming detection have been evaluated based on the metrics used in the grooming detection problem. We have also categorized the available datasets and used feature vectors to give readers a deep knowledge of the problem considering their constraints and open research gaps. Finally, this survey details the constraints that challenge grooming detection, unaddressed problems, and possible future solutions to improve the state-of-the-art and make the algorithms more reliable. © 2022 The Author(s)","Chat analysis;

A cyber-predator may interact with or gather confidential data about children without being physically present if IoT toys are hacked. Authentication to verify user identity is essential for all internet-connected applications, where relying on single authentication is not considered safe, especially in children's applications. Children often use easy-to-guess passwords in smart applications associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) for children's toys. In this paper, we propose to activate multi-factor authentication on the IoTs for children's toys connected to the internet using companion applications. When changing the user's behaviour (by IP address, GPS, OS version, and browser), the child's identity must be verified by two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to preserve the child's safety and privacy. This paper introduces multi-authentication mechanisms: a password and another authentication type, either mobile phone SMS, security token, digital certificate, or biometric authentication.  © 2022 IEEE.","authentication; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy; security; smart toys","Authentication; Behavioral research; Cybersecurity; Safety factor; Toys; Children's toys; Confidential data; Internet of thing; Multi-factor authentication; Privacy; Security; Security community; Smart applications; Smart toy; User identity; Internet of things","","","","","","","Shah T., Venkatesan S., Authentications of IoT devices and IoT servers using secure vaults, Proc. 17th IEEE International Conferences on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications and 12th IEEE International Conferences on Big Data Sciences and Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE, pp. 819-824, (2018); Chu G., Apthorpe N., Feamster N., Security and privacy analysis of the IoT children's toys, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 1, pp. 978-985, (2019); Rivera D., Garcia A., Martin-Ruiz M.L., Alarcos B., Velasco J.R., Gomez Oliva A., Secure communication and protected data for an internet of things smart toy platforms, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 2, pp. 3785-3795, (2019); Shasha S., Mahmoud M., Mannan M., Youssef A., Playing with danger: A taxonomy and evaluations of threat to smart toy, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 6, 2, pp. 2986-3002, (2018); Two-factor Authentication Provides Additional Security, (2017); Valente J., Cardenas A.A., Security and privacy in smart toys, Proceedings of Workshop on Internet of Things Security and Privacy, pp. 19-24, (2017); Haron G.R., Maniam D., Mat Nen L., Daud N.I., User behaviour and interactions for multimodal authentication, Proc. of 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST, pp. 309-316, (2016); Weaver A.C., Biometric authentication, Computer, 39, 2, pp. 96-97, (2006); Nobakht M., Sivaraman V., Boreli R., A host-based intrusions detection and mitigations frameworks for smart home IoTs using OpenFlow, Proc. of 11th International Conferences on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES, pp. 147-156, (2016); Bendiab G., Shiaeles S., Alruban A., Kolokotronis N., IoT malware network traffic classification using visual representations and deep learning, Proc.

Although reactive predator detection methods have been studied, proactive victim protection and crime prevention can also be achieved through vulnerability analysis of potential youth victims. Despite its significance, vulnerability analysis has not been thoroughly studied in the data science literature, while several social science studies used survey-based methods. To address this gap, we investigate humans' social-psychological traits and quantify key vulnerability factors to cybergrooming by analyzing text features in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Through pairwise correlation studies, we demonstrate the degrees of key vulnerability dimensions to cybergrooming from youths' conversational features. Our findings reveal that victims have negative correlations with family and community traits, contrasting with previous social survey studies that indicated family relationships or social support as key vulnerability factors. We discuss the current limitations of text mining analysis and suggest cross-validation methods to increase the validity of research findings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into understanding the vulnerability factors to cybergrooming and highlights the importance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","and vulnerability.; cybergrooming; Natural language processing; online social deception; social-psychological analysis; text mining","Cybersecurity; Data mining; Social networking (online); And vulnerability.; Cybergrooming; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online social deception; Psychological analysis; Social-psychological analyse; Text-mining; Vulnerability analysis; Natural language processing systems","","","","","ISDA-ISERC; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, VT","This research is partly supported by Virginia Tech’s ISDA-ISERC (Integrated Security Destination Area-The Integrated Security Education and Research Center) Research Program.","Muslah Albladi S., Weir G.Rs., Predicting individuals' vulnerability to social engineering in social networks, Cybersecurity, 3, 1, pp. 1-19, (2020); Anderson P., Zuo Z., Yang L., Qu Y., An Intelligent Online Grooming Detection System Using AI Technologies, 2019 Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), pp. 1-6, (2019); Badillo-Urquiola K., Shea Z., Agha Z., Lediaeva I., Wisniewski P., Conducting Risky Research with Teens: Co-Designing for the Ethical Treatment and Protection of Adolescents, Proc.

In this paper, we first examined the profit chain of XPUAs and then proposed PUAXray, a novel detection system that utilized machine learning to identify XPUAs. PUAXray used a binary classifier that was trained on features extracted from cross-platform payloads, including semantics information and third-party library usage information. We evaluated PUAXray on a dataset that was created for the first time in the community with benign apps from reputable app markets and XPUAs from an industry collaborator.

From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.  © 2021 ACM.","artificial intelligence; human-centered machine learning; literature review; online risks; sexual risk detection; social media","Computational methods; Crime; E-learning; Machine learning; Computational approach; Computational risks; Human-centered machine learning; Literature reviews; Online risk; Risk detections; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Systematic literature review; Victimisation; Social networking (online)","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (-1827700, -1844881); William T.

All of the reports strongly suggested that it becomes very urgent to tackle the online child grooming problem in order to protect children from sexual exploitation. Automatic sexual predator identification can be a promising solution to this issue since the number of online conversations is too large to be monitored manually. In this work, a two-stage is proposed with a combination of several features. The first stage is for detecting the predatory conversations while the second step aims to distinguish the predator from the victim in the predatory conversations. The features ensemble used will be combining lexical and behavioral features. The lexical features used include BoW, POS-based, topical, and emotion-based. Meanwhile, the behavioral features used for this work include the number of messages, the average number of words, the number of exclamation marks, the number of questions, sentence complexity and readability, and the number of intentions. SVM was used as a classifier due to its good ability for many text classification tasks. The experiment result shows that BoW with tf - idf term weighting provided the best performance for both PCI and VPD tasks. BoW with tf- idf term weighting obtained an F0.5 score of 0.9893 on PCI and 0.9798 on VPD. The features ensemble can exceed most of the individual features that form it but still cannot beat BoW. © 2023 IEEE.","Bag of Words; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Sexual Predator; SVM","Classification (of information); Text processing; Average numbers; Bag of words; Behavioral features; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Lexical features; Sexual predator; SVM; Term weighting; Support vector machines","","","","","","","Wachs S., Wolf K.D., Pan C.-C., Cybergrooming: Risk factors, coping strategies and associations with cyberbullying, Psicothema, 24, 4, pp. 628-633, (2012); Choo K.-K.R., Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences, 103, (2009); Kierkegaard S., Cybering, online grooming and ageplay, Computer Law & Security Review, 24, 1, pp. 41-55, (2008); Clement J., Internet usage of teenagers in the united states - statistics facts, (2019); Britain G., Children and parents: Media use and attitudes report, (2013); Madigan S., Villani V., Azzopardi C., Laut D., Smith T., Temple J.R., Browne D., Dimitropoulos G., The prevalence of unwanted online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth: A meta-analysis, Journal of Adolescent Health, 63, 2, pp. 133-141, (2018); Vilarino D., Castillo E., Pinto D., Olmos I., Leon S., Information retrieval and classification based approaches for the sexual predator identification; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, 2019 International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET).

However, most studies focus only on one platform or one of the gateways of cyber-trafficking. Thus, this paper introduces the development and comparison of the Naive Bayes Algorithm, Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models to predict trafficking and non-trafficking websites. In developing the supervised classification models, 37 keywords were used to scrape suspected trafficking websites. Thirty-five (35) websites were classified as trafficker out of 63; this data was used to create the models. Upon evaluating the accuracy rates of the models, the Naive Bayes Algorithm got ninety-one percent (91%), Logistic Regression got eighty-one percent (81%), KNN got sixty-four percent (64%), and SVM got sixty-four percent (64%). Thus, Naive Bayes can predict more accurately than the other classification algorithms. The result shows that the predictive model could be an effective tool for identifying different online platforms that are used in trafficking. Once the model is integrated into an application, this will be easier and faster for law enforcement agencies to monitor human trafficking in a fast-growing cyberspace community. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Classification algorithm; Cyber trafficking; Human trafficking; K-nearest neighbor (KNN); Logistic regression; Naïve bayes; Support vector machine","Crime; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Websites; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Cybe trafficing; Human trafficking; K-near neighbor; Logistics regressions; Naive bayes; Naive-Bayes algorithm; Nearest-neighbour; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","","","","","","","Definition and Scale.Learn More about Human Trafficking and How Prevalent This Fast-Growing Crime Is, (2022); Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, (2009); Trafficking in Persons Report: Philippines, (2022); Latonero M., Human Trafficking Online: The Role of Social Networking Sites and Online Classi-Fieds.

However, current techniques still suffer from some limits that restrict their practical application, such as the use of errors as a key feature to train the lie detectors and the absence of normalized features. Here, an extension of a keystroke dynamics technique, which was recently proposed to detect faked identities, is reported with the goal to overcome these limitations. Using a Quadratic Discriminant Analysis an accuracy up to 92% in the identification of faked identities has been reached, even if errors were excluded from predictors and normalized features were included. The classification model performs similarly to those previously proposed, with a slightly lower accuracy (−3%) but overcoming their important practical limitations. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Identity verification; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detection","Discriminant analysis; Human engineering; Security of data; Behavioral measures; Classification models; Demographic information; Key feature; Keystroke dynamics; Lie detectors; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Dynamics","","","","","","","Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, SocInfo 2014.

These cybercrimes are common against children, demanding the implementation of automated systems and models to detect and counteract these crimes. By keeping in view the growing importance of AI-enabled cybersecurity systems, this article provides insights regarding implementing the relevant systems and models to counteract cybercrimes against children in Pakistan. The researchers reviewed current studies witnessing the performance, reliability, and results of AI implementation in different countries to relate their possible potential further to detect, takedown, and trace online violence against children effectively. Findings showed that AI-enabled software, i.e., Spotlight, SomeBuddy, Google AI Tool, etc., and models such as DAPHNE, iCOP toolkit, and PrevBOT can identify and takedown any indecent activity against children. Besides, detecting the perpetrators’ URLs, domains, and personal emails can further help the children resume internet usage in a healthy online environment. Thus, it is concluded that the internet technology is also creating vectors for abuse and exploitation against children. Harnessing powerful technology, i.e., AI, to analyze and manage the data can also enrich investigative functions.

By reviewing 224 research papers, we identified 10 characteristics of technology that facilitate sexual abuse: covertness, publicness, anonymity, evolution, boundlessness, reproducibility, accessibility, indispensability, malleability, and opaqueness. We also analyzed how technology assists victims and other stakeholders in coping with and responding to sexual abuse. Our research questions examined the challenges in using technology to address sexual abuse too. For instance, its use by victims can lead to revictimization. To address technology's challenges, we offer recommendations and suggest new research directions. These findings about the dual nature of technology can inform research and development toward better support for victims of sexual abuse.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Body of knowledge; Contextualize; Reproducibilities; Research and development; Research papers; Research questions; Technology challenges","","","","","Laboratory for Education and Research in Secure Systems Engineering; Vesta Social Innovation Technologies Inc.; Mitacs","Funding text 1: VIII.

Although cybergrooming has been recognized as a cybercrime, there is a lack of programs to protect youth from cybergrooming. We present a generative chatbot framework, SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate fluent authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot. Furthermore, we propose deep-reinforcement-learning-based dialogue generation with a stage-related reward to lead the conversation to the expected stage. We also minimize potential ethical issues introduced by the perverted languages when deploying the chatbots for cybersecurity education programs. We evaluated the conversations of SERI with open-source referenced, unreferenced metrics and human evaluation. We developed SERI as a platform for deploying perpetrator chatbot to interact with youth users to observe their responses and collect reactions when they are asked for private or sensitive information by the perpetrator. © 2023 IEEE.","chatbots; Cybergrooming; deep reinforcement learning; natural language processing","Cybersecurity; Deep learning; E-learning; Natural language processing systems; Chatbots; Cyber-crimes; Cybergrooming; Deep reinforcement learning; Dialogue generations; Educational program; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Guo Z., Cho J.-H., Chen I.-R., Sengupta S., Hong M., Mitra T., Online social deception and its countermeasures: A survey, Ieee Access, 9, pp. 1770-1806, (2021); Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, 2020 8th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), pp. 1-6, (2020); Guo Z., Wang P., Cho J.-H., Huang L., Text miningbased social-psychological vulnerability analysis of potential victims to cybergrooming: Insights and lessons learned, Www '23 Companion, pp. 1381-1388, (2023); Choo K.R., Online Child Grooming: A Literature Review on the Misuse of Social Networking Sites for Grooming Children for Sexual Offences, 103, (2009); Lateef F., Simulation-based learning: Just like the real thing, Journal of Emergencies, Trauma and Shock, 3, 4, (2010); Winters G., Jeglic E., Stages of sexual grooming: Recognizing potentially predatory behaviors of child molesters, Deviant Behavior, pp. 1-10, (2016); Zambrano P., Torres J., Tello-Oquendo L., Jacome R., Benalcazar M.E., Andrade R., Fuertes W., Technical mapping of the grooming anatomy using machine learning paradigms: An information security approach, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 142129-142146, (2019); Laorden C., Galan-Garcia P., Santos I., Sanz B., Hidalgo J.M., Bringas P.G., Negobot: A conversational agent based on game theory for the detection of paedophile behaviour, International Joint Conference CISIS'12-ICEUTE 12-SOCO 12 Special Sessions, pp. 261-270, (2013); Wolf T., Sanh V., Chaumond J., Delangue C., TransferTransfo: A transfer learning approach for neural network based conversational agents, CoRR, (2019); Roy N., Pineau J., Thrun S., Spoken dialogue management using probabilistic reasoning, Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 93-100, (2000); Lan R., Wang J., Huang W., Deng Z., Sun X., Chen Z., Luo X., Chinese emotional dialogue response generation via reinforcement learning, Acm Transactions on Internet Technology, 21, 4, pp. 1-17, (2021); Lai H., Toral A., Nissim M., Thank You BART!

The activation functions often suffer from 'gradient vanishing', 'non zero-centred function outputs', 'exploding gradients', and 'dead neurons', which may lead to deterioration in the classification performance. This paper proposes an activation function generation approach using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang inference in an effort to address such challenges. In addition, the proposed method further optimises the coefficients in the activation function using the genetic algorithm such that the activation function can adapt to different applications. This approach has been applied to a digital forensics application of online grooming detection. The evaluations confirm the superiority of the proposed activation function for online grooming detection using an unbalanced data set. © 2019 IEEE.","","Chemical activation; Deterioration; Digital forensics; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Activation functions; Adaptive activation function; Classification performance; Dead neurons; Forensic applications; Function generation; Fuzzy inferencer; Neural-networks; Takagi-sugeno; Text categorization; Fuzzy inference","","","","","","","Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, Proc.

Extremists' use of social media over the past decade or so has raised increasing concern among governments and media corporations alike. In Digital Grooming Nuria Lorenzo-Dus analyzes manipulation practices in digital spaces that are situated at, or beyond, the boundaries of law. Lorenzo-Dus identifies and examines in detail the online discourse of adults luring children for sexual abuse and exploitation (digital sexual grooming); extreme ideology groups aligning others to their views (digital ideological grooming); and drug dealers soliciting business in crypto markets (digital commercial grooming). With sophisticated style and stance analyses of large and varied datasets, the book reveals that digital sexual, ideological, and commercial grooming practices have much in common. Three stances—expertise, openness, and avidity—scaffold this manipulative work, which constructs groomers and their targets as sharing a homogenous identity. By shedding new light on grooming practices, this book provides a key resource for discourse analysis, forensic linguistics, communication, and media studies, as well as for practitioners aiming to counter online grooming through policy changes, detection software, and prevention-focused training to promote digital civility and safety. © Oxford University Press 2023.

Doria 6, Catania, 95125, Italy","Internet can be misused by cyber criminals as a platform to conduct illegitimate activities (such as harassment, cyber bullying, and incitement of hate or violence) anonymously. As a result, authorship analysis of anonymous texts in Internet (such as emails, forum comments) has attracted significant attention in the digital forensic and text mining communities. The main problem is a large number of possible of authors, which hinders the effective identification of a true author. We interpret open class author attribution as a process of expert recommendation where the decision support system returns a list of suspected authors for further analysis by forensics experts rather than a single prediction result, thus reducing the scale of the problem. We describe the task formally and present algorithms for constructing the suspected author list. For evaluation we propose using a simple Winner-Takes-All (WTA) metric as well as a set of gain-discount model based metrics from the information retrieval domain (mean reciprocal rank, discounted cumulative gain and rank-biased precision). We also propose the List Precision (LP) metric as an extension of WTA for evaluating the usability of the suspected author list. For experiments, we use our own dataset of Internet comments in Lithuanian language and consider the use of language-specific (Lithuanian) lexical features together with general lexical features derived from English language. For classification we use one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results of experiments show that the usability of open class author attribution can be improved considerably by using a set of language-specific lexical features together with general lexical features, while the proposed method can be used to reduce the number of suspected authors thus alleviating the work of forensic linguists. © 2017 PTI.","","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Digital forensics; Information systems; Internet; Support vector machines; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Expert recommendations; Information retrieval domain; Internet comments; Mean reciprocal ranks; One-class classifier; One-class support vector machine; Taxonomies","","","","","Programme EC DG Home Affairs ISEC; European Commission, EC","The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of the project “Lithuanian Cybercrime Centre of Excellence for Training, Research & Education” (L3CE) project, Grant Agreement No. HOME/2013/ISEC/AG/INT/4000005176), financed by European Commission under the Programme EC DG Home Affairs ISEC (Prevention of and against crime 2007-2013).","Irons A., Lallie H.S., Digital forensics to intelligent forensics, Future Internet, 6, pp. 584-596, (2014); Chaski C.E., Author identification in the forensic setting, The Oxford Handbook of Forensic Linguistics, (2012); Iqbal F., Binsalleeh H., Fung B.C.M., Debbabi M., A unified data mining solution for authorship analysis in anonymous textual communications, Inf.

Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13-17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of ""safe""versus ""risky"". Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.  © 2022 ACM.","adolescents disclosures; artificial intelligence; sexting; sexual risk detection; sexual risks; social media","Adolescent disclosure; Classifieds; Internet access; Mixed method; Peer support; Risk detections; Sexting; Sexual risk; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Social networking (online)","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIP-1827700, IIS-1844881); William T.

Cyberpredators commit their crimes by employing the Internet and online services-social network platforms, online groups and organizations, smart phone apps, bulletin board systems, online forums, websites, internet relay chat channels-to locate and harm victims of all ages through attacking, exploiting, humiliating, bullying, harassing, threatening, defrauding, and extorting. Cyberpredators and Their Prey describes non-sexual and sexual interpersonal crimes-online romance scam, swatting, trolling, stalking, bullying, harassment, minor sexting, sexual trafficking, child sexual abuse material, sextortion, and image-based sexual abuse offenses. Each chapter contains: crime definition and relevant issues; typical cyberpredator, motives, and methods; typical victims and behaviors that make them targets; current criminal laws for prosecuting cybercrimes and assessment of their applicability and effectiveness as deterrents; the crime’s impact on individual victims and society in general; and cybersecurity prevention and intervention strategies. Also covered are the unique challenges that the regulation, investigation, and prosecution of these cybercrimes pose to criminal justice and private security agents worldwide; the need for society to hold companies operating online responsible for their role in cybercrime; and how aspects of the online environment (i.e., anonymity, toxic disinhibition, de-individuation, inculpability) contribute to harmful and abusive interpersonal interaction, particularly when enacted by perpetrators as part of a group attack. Key features: • Portrays material through multidisciplinary lens of psychology, criminal justice, law, and security • Provides consistent, practical information about online criminals and victims • Compares online to offline versions of the same crime • Discusses adequacy of current laws for prosecuting cybercriminals • Considers elements of the online environment that foster criminal activity • Describes social engineering techniques • Considers the role of intimate partner violence in cybercrimes • Reviews 21st century skills needed to educate and protect potential targets Cyberpredators and Their Prey will prove essential reading to those who are studying to become, or are currently, security professionals; law enforcement personnel and investigators; intelligence agents; private investigators; lawyers; compliance officers; social service workers; and other professionals who deal with interpersonal cybercrime through the lens of social science. © 2023 Lauren R.

The number of vulnerabilities exploited has also risen in tandem with the increased sales. The attack vectors have greatly increased due to the connectivity and mass functionality of these devices. The lack of security in smartwatches, marketed towards children, poses a prominent threat for their safety and security. Results reported in this paper revealed significant security vulnerabilities in several popular kids’ smartwatches when exploited by SMS command injection, Bluetooth tracking and Wi-Fi man in the middle attack. The devices investigated were kids’ smartwatches, a fitness tracker and a smart phone with varying functions, connections and security features. Findings of the paper raise concerns as vulnerabilities of kids’ IoT smart devices can lead to criminal cases, such as child grooming and child abduction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Child abduction; Child grooming; Cybercrime; Fitbit; IoT; Pentesting; Smartwatches","","","","","","","","Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Makhdoom I., Abolhasan M., Lipman J., Liu R.P., Ni W., Anatomy of threats to the internet of things, IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 21, 2, pp. 1636-1675, (2018); Alladi T., Chamola V., Sikdar B., Choo K.K.R., Consumer IoT: Security vulnerability case studies and solutions, IEEE Consum Electron Mag, 9, 2, pp. 17-25, (2020); Liao B., Ali Y., Nazir S., He L., Khan H.U., Security analysis of IoT devices by using mobile computing: A systematic literature review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 120331-120350, (2020); Saatjohann C., Ising F., Krings L., Schinzel S., STALK: Security analysis of smartwatches for kids.

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors' classifiers. Besides, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method, which classifies a conversation using the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 textual conversations of which 105 are grooming, and 45 are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and k-NN can identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Grooming classifier; K-nearest neighbors; Online child grooming; Support vector machine","","","","","","","","Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Whittle H., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A., Collings G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns, Aggression and violent behavior, 18, 1, pp. 62-70, (2013); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC), pp. 864-869, (2011); Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Leatherman A., Text mining and cybercrime, Text Mining: Applications and Theory, (2010); Mitchell K.J., Finkelhor D., Wolak J., Police posing as juveniles online to catch sex offenders: Is it working?, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17, 3, pp. 241-267, (2005); Briggs P., Simon W.T., Simonsen S., An exploratory study of internet-initiated sexual offenses and the chat room sex offender: Has the internet enabled a new typology of sex offender?, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, (2010); Webster S., Davidson J., Bifulco A., Gottschalk P., Pham C.V.T., Grove-Hills J., Turley C., Tompkins C., Ciulla S., Milazzo V., Schimmenti A., Craparo G., European online grooming project, (2012); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, Journal of advances in information technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Babaoglu I., Findik O., Ulker E., A comparison of feature selection models utilizing binary particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm in determining coronary artery disease using support vector machine, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 4, pp. 3177-3183, (2010); Acharya U.R., Ng E., Tan J.H., Sree S.V., Thermography based breast cancer detection using texture features and support vector machine, Journal of medical systems, 36, 3, pp. 1503-1510, (2012); Horng S.J., Su M.Y., Chen Y.H., Kao T.W., Chen R.J., Lai J.L., Perkasa C.D., A novel intrusion detection system based on hierarchical clustering and support vector machines, Expert systems with Applications, 38, 1, pp. 306-313, (2011); O'Connel R.A., Typology of cybersex exploitation and online grooming process, (2014); Gupta V., Lehal G., A survey of text summarization extractive techniques, Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence, 2, 3, pp. 258-268, (2010); Christianni N., Shawe Taylor J., An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, (2000); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning, (2008); Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, Journal of advances in information technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Powers D.M., Evaluation: From precision, recall, and F-measure to roc, informedness, markedness & correlation, Journal of Machine Learning Technologies, 2, 1, pp. 37-63, (2011); Justice P.; Wollis M., A linguistic analysis of online predator grooming, (2011); Bergen E., Davidson J., Schulz A., Schuhmann P., Johansson A., The effects of using identity deception and suggesting secrecy on the outcomes of adult-adult and adult-child or-adolescent online sexual interactions, Victims and Offenders, 9, pp. 276-298, (2014)","F.E.

Unfortunately, the authorship of many of them remains unknown. In some channels, the problem of establishing authorship may be even harder, since the length of digital texts is limited to a certain number of characters. In this work, we aim at identifying authors of tweet messages, which are limited to 280 characters. We evaluate popular features employed traditionally in authorship attribution which capture properties of the writing style at different levels. We use for our experiments a self-captured database of 40 users, with 120 to 200 tweets per user. Results using this small set are promising, with the different features providing a classification accuracy between 92% and 98.5%. These results are competitive in comparison to existing studies which employ short texts such as tweets or SMS. © 2020 IEEE.","Authorship Attribution; Authorship Identification; Forensics; Microblogging; N-Grams; Stylometry","Forensic science; Authorship analysis; Authorship attribution; Classification accuracy; Criminal investigation; Digital text; Microblogging; Stylometric features; Writing style; Biometrics","","","","","Swedish Knowledge Foundation; Vetenskapsrådet, VR; European Social Fund, ESF","Author F.

What does itmean to be a man in contemporary society? How is masculinity constituted in different media spaces? This growing cultural tension around masculinities has been discussed and analyzed both for general audiences and in burgeoning academic scholarship. What has been typically overlooked, however, is the role that language plays in these mediated performances of masculinity. In Language and Mediated Masculinities, Robert Lawson draws on data from newspapers, social media sites, television programs, and online forums to explore language and masculinities across a range of media contexts. The book offers a critical evaluation of the intersection between language, masculinities, and identities in contemporary society and addresses three key questions: How are masculinities constructed, in both public and private spheres, through linguistic and discursive strategies? How does language about masculinity and men affect (and recreate) gender ideologies in different social, political, and historical contexts? What might the language of men tell us about the state of contemporary gender relations in the twenty-first century? Lawson furthers our understanding of how language is implicated in (re)creating gender ideologies and how it shapes contemporary gender relations. Against a cultural backdrop of rising neoliberalism, ethnic nationalism, online radicalization, networked misogyny, and fractious gender relations, this book is an important contribution to charting how language is used to monitor, evaluate, and police masculinities in online and offline spaces. © Oxford University Press 2023.

This capability has many benefits, but it can also be used by malevolent individuals, i.e. predators. Anonymity exacerbates the problem. The motivation of our work is to help protect our children from this potentially hostile environment, without excluding them from utilizing its benefits. In our research, we aim to develop an online sexual predator identification system, designed to detect cybercrime related to child grooming. We will use AI techniques to analyze chat interactions available from different social networks. However, before any meaningful analysis can be carried out, chats must be pre-processed into a consistent and suitable format. This task poses challenges in itself. In this paper we show how different and diverse chat formats can be automatically normalized into a consistent text-based format that can be subsequently used for analysis. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Chat logs; Deep learning; Online predator identification","Computer crime; Pattern recognition; AI techniques; Cybercrime; Data preprocessing; Hostile environments; On-line interactions; Social media; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Online chat”; Dan L., Identifying Cyber Predators by Using Sentiment Analysis and Recurrent Neural Networks, (2018); Ebrahimi M., Automatic identification of online predators in chat logs by anomaly detection and deep learning, M.Comp.Sc.

The use by minors of social networks applications, and games that are connected to the internet offer the possibility of communication, can make them exposed to various threats. One of the most troubling threats is sexual abuse. Thus the objective of this project is to create a model for classifying messages, as normal or dangerous, according to the risk they present to the minor. In addition to integrating the developed model with a project that analyzes the behavior of minors in a social network (Facebook), and calculates the risk of the minor be a victim of sexual abuse. Finally, we use the model in the classification of messages obtained from a server of the game Minecraft, quite popular among children. © 2018, © 2018 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.","children and teenagers protection; clustering messages; messages exchange classification; minecraft; social media","","","","","","","","Araujo Leite J.L., Mineracao de textos do twitter utilizando tecnicas de classificação, (2015); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predatorsProceedings of the 3rd workshop in computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, (2012); Carletta J., Assessing agreement on classification tasks: The Kappa statistic, Computational Linguistics, 22, 2, pp. 249-254, (1996); Cheng Y., Chen K., Sun H., Zhang Y., Tao F., Data and knowledge mining with big data towards smart production, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 9, pp. 1-13, (2018); de Souza Viana T.S., de Oliveira M., da Silva T.L.C., Junior M.S.R.F., Goncalves E.J.T., Textual analysis for the protection of children and teenagers in social media–classification of inappropriate messages for children and teenagersProceedings of the 19th international conference on enterprise information systems–Volume 2: ICEIS, (2017); Duan L., Binbasioglu M., An ensemble framework for community detection, Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 5, pp. 1-5, (2017); Duan L., Xu L., Business intelligence for enterprise systems: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 3, pp. 679-687, (2012); Falcao Jr M.S.R., Goncalves E.J.T., da Silva T.L.C., de Oliveira M., Behavioral analysis for child protection in social network through data mining and multiagent systemsProceedings of the 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems–Volume 2: ICEIS, (2016); Fayyad U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro G., Smyth P., Advances in knowledge discovery and data miningChapter from data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview, (1996); Hall M., Frank E., Holmes G., Pfahringer B., Reutemann P., Witten I.H., The WEKA data mining software: An update, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11, 1, pp. 10-18, (2009); Macwan S., inz Grzegorz Filcek D., Web mining against pedophilia, International Education and Research Journal, 3, 5, (2017); McCallum A., Nigam K., AAAI-98 workshop on learning for text categorization, (1998); Metsis V., Androutsopoulos I., Paliouras G., Spam filtering with Naive Bayes–which Naive Bayes?, (2006); Moreno-Sandoval L.G., Beltran-Herrera P., Vargas-Cruz J.A., Sanchez-Barriga C., Pomares-Quimbaya A., Alvarado-Valencia J.A., Garcia-Diaz J.C., CSL: A combined Spanish lexicon–resource for polarity classification and sentiment analysisProceedings of the 19th international conference on enterprise information systems–Volume 1: ICEIS, (2017); Morris C., Hirst G., CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), (2012); Tan P.N., Introduction to data mining, (2006); Velmurugan T., Santhanam T., Computational complexity between k-means and k-medoids clustering algorithms for normal and uniform distributions of data points, Journal of Computer Science, 6, pp. 363-368, (2010); Yuan R., Li Z., Guan X., Xu L., An SVM-based machine learning method for accurate internet traffic classification, Information Systems Frontiers, 12, 2, pp. 149-156, (2010)","M. de Oliveira; Universidade Federal do Ceará, Quixadá, Brazil; email: marcos.oliveira@ufc.br","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","23270012","","","","English","J.

Although offenders may try to conceal their identity, these sexts often include hand, knuckle, and nail bed imagery. Objective: We present a novel biometric hand verification tool designed to identify online child sexual exploitation offenders from images or videos based on biometric/forensic features extracted from hand regions. The system can match and authenticate hand component imagery against a constrained custody suite reference of a known subject by employing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. Data: We conducted experiments on two hand datasets: Purdue University and Hong Kong. In particular, the Purdue dataset collected for this study allowed us to evaluate the system performance on various parameters, with specific emphasis on camera distance and orientation. Methods: To explore the performance and reliability of the biometric verification models, we considered several parameters, including hand orientation, distance from the camera, single or multiple fingers, architecture of the models, and performance loss functions. Results: Results showed the best performance for pictures sampled from the same database and with the same image capture conditions. Conclusion: The authors conclude the biometric hand verification tool offers a robust solution that will operationally impact law enforcement by allowing agencies to investigate and identify online child sexual exploitation offenders more effectively. We highlight the strength of the system and the current limitations. © 2024","Biometric identification; Forensic investigative tool; Hands; Knuckles; Online child sexual exploitation","algorithm; Article; biometry; data extraction; forensic imaging; human; image analysis; image quality; information processing; nail bed","","","","","Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP; Lafayette Police Department; Office of Justice Programs, OJP; U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ, (2019-MC-FX-K063, 15PJDP-21-GK-03269-MECP); U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ","We would like to acknowledge the Tippecanoe County Prosecutor's Office, Tippecanoe High Tech Crime Unit, and Lafayette Police Department for their support in carrying out this research project.

In this respect, the Likelihood Ratio is an appropriate approach to show the strength of the evidence in forensic sciences.

Yet, there has been little research as to how these experiences impact teens' mood over time, or how long these effects may last. To examine the effects of online risk exposure on mood, we asked 68 teens to report their weekly online risk experiences, emotions, and sense of well-being for two months. We found that teens experienced more negative emotions the week that they reported cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content, but these effects were gone one week later. In addition, teens reported a slight increase in positive emotions and mental well-being during weeks they were exposed to other risks. Our results suggest that most of the risks teens in our study experienced online only pose brief negative effects, if any, and initiates a discussion on how our society may overly problematize the negative effects of online risk exposure on teens. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adolescent online safety; Cyberbullying; Diary study; Explicit content; Information breaches; Privacy; Sexual solicitations","Computer crime; Data privacy; Cyber bullying; Diary study; Explicit content; Information breaches; Sexual solicitations; Risk management","","","","","","","Adler A., To catch a predator, Columbia Journal of Gender and Law, 21, pp. 130-561, (2012); Aguinis H., Boik R.J., Pierce C.A., A generalized solution for approximating the power to detect effects of categorical moderator variables using multiple regression, Organizational Research Methods, 4, 4, pp. 291-323, (2001); Allen J.R., Of resilience, vulnerability, and a woman who never lived, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 7, 1, pp. 53-71, (1998); Almeida D.M., Resilience and vulnerability to daily stressors assessed via diary methods, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 14, 2, pp. 64-68, (2005); Bazelon E., Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy, (2013); Bernstein M.S., Monroy-Hernandez A., Harry D., Andre P., Panovich K., Vargas G.G., 4chan and/b: An analysis of anonymity and ephemerality in a large online community, Proceedings of the Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 50-57, (2011); Berriman L., Thomson R., Spectacles of intimacy?

In this paper, we investigate different feature extraction approaches for predatory detection. While the previous results indicate good accuracy on predatory conversation detection, there is a missing investigation on the robustness of feature space. Further, we also show the impact of preprocessing on data to improve the performance of predator identification and predatory message classification. Various types of the bag of words features, including binary, term frequency, and TF-IDF representation are investigated on the publicly available PAN 2012 competition dataset for predator identification. Further, to cover the relationship between the words in the text analysis, the GloVe feature set is also investigated for word embedding features. With the set of preprocessing of data, we illustrate the improvement in detecting predatory conversation with an accuracy of 0.994 and F1-score of 0.964.  © 2020 IEEE.","","Semantics; Social networking (online); Bag of words; F1 scores; Feature sets; Feature space; Message identification; Pre-processing of data; Term Frequency; Text analysis; Feature extraction","","","","","","","Seto M.C., Pedophilia and sexual offenses against children, Annual Review of Sex Research, 15, 1, pp. 321-361, (2004); Miller L., Sexual offenses against children: Patterns and motives, Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18, 5, pp. 506-519, (2013); Craven S., Brown S., Gilchrist E., Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature and theoretical considerations, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 12, 3, pp. 287-299, (2006); Borj P.R., Bours P., Detecting liars in chats using keystroke dynamics, Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Conference on Biometric Engineering and Applications, pp. 1-6, (2019); Potthast M., Rosso P., Stamatatos E., Stein B., A decade of shared tasks in digital text forensics at pan, European Conference on Information Retrieval, pp. 291-300, (2019); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF (Online Working Notes/labs/workshop, 30, (2012); McTear M.F., Callejas Z., Griol D., The conversational interface, Springer, 6, 94, (2016); Robertson S., Understanding inverse document frequency: On theoretical arguments for idf, Journal of Documentation, 60, 5, pp. 503-520, (2004); Zhang W., Yoshida T., Tang X., A comparative study of tf idf, lsi and multi-words for text classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 3, pp. 2758-2765, (2011); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP, pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Egan V., Hoskinson J., Shewan D., Perverted justice: A content analysis of the language used by offenders detected attempting to solicit children for sex, Antisocial Behavior: Causes, Correlations and Treatments, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (2011); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Lorenzo-Dus N., Izura C., Cause ur special"": Understanding trust and complimenting behaviour in online grooming discourse, Journal of Pragmatics, 112, pp. 68-82, (2017); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007).

This paper reviews the existing BEA approaches and process models and concludes the lack of standardisation in the BEA process. The research comprehends that existing BEA methodologies are restricted to specific characteristics of the forensic domain in question. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a standardised approach detailing the step-by-step implementation of BEA in the DF process. The proposed model presents a homogenous technique that can be practically applied to real-life cases. This standard BEA framework classifies digital evidence into categories to decipher associated offender characteristics. Unlike existing models, this new approach collects evidence from diverse sources and leaves no aspect unattended while probing criminal behavioural cues, thus facilitating its applicability across varied forensic domains. © 2021 IGI Global.

It provides an authoritative synthesis of the disparate literature on the various types of cybercrime, the global investigation and detection of cybercrime and the role of digital information, and the wider role of technology as a facilitator for social relationships between deviants and criminals. It includes coverage of: Key theoretical and methodological perspectives; computer hacking and malicious software; digital piracy and intellectual theft; economic crime and online fraud; pornography and online sex crime; cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking; cyber-terrorism and extremism; digital forensic investigation and its legal context around the world; the law enforcement response to cybercrime transnationally; cybercrime policy and legislation across the globe. The new edition features two new chapters, the first looking at the law enforcement response to cybercrime and the second offering an extended discussion of online child pornography and sexual exploitation. This book includes lively and engaging features, such as discussion questions, boxed examples of unique events and key figures in offending, quotes from interviews with active offenders, and a full glossary of terms. This new edition includes QR codes throughout to connect directly with relevant websites. It is supplemented by a companion website that includes further exercises for students and instructor resources.

The authors have drawn on their extensive experience in training undercover officers to develop innovative methods in identifying the creation and performance of online personas, crucial in detecting identity disguise online. This groundbreaking book demonstrates these methods through case studies, whilst also exploring the link between language and identity. By bringing together previously opposed positions in forensic authorship analysis, the book develops a novel theory of linguistic identity, which will resonate not just in forensic authorship research but in sociolinguistics more widely. This unique forensic linguistic project has real-life impact in assisting the police in their investigation of online abusers, and has impact for students and researchers of linguistics, through its contribution to the research of linguistic identities. © Tim Grant and Nicci MacLeod 2020.

A number of approaches have been proposed to analyze the content of the messages to identify predatory conversations. However, due to the non-availability of large-scale predatory data, the state-of-the-art works employ a standard dataset that has less than 10% predatory conversations. Dealing with such heavy class imbalance is a challenge to devise reliable predatory detection approaches. We present a new approach for dealing with class imbalance using a hybrid sampling and class re-distribution to obtain an augmented dataset. To further improve the diversity of classifiers and features in the ensembles, we also propose to perturb the data along with augmentation in an iterative manner. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate an improvement of 3% over the best state-of-the-art approach and results in an F1-score of 0.99 and an Fβ of 0.94 from the proposed approach. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

In this day and age, traditional literacy proves inadequate and digital literacy has become a necessity within the education sector. The COVID-19 pandemic and the intensification of the industrial revolution mean that education has rapidly shifted online. It has, therefore, become important to understand the challenges faced in the move to online teaching and learning in Malaysia, especially in this post-pandemic era. This chapter discusses the concept of digital literacy, as well as various motivating factors for educators and learners to make the migration from traditional to online teaching and learning. These challenges include the lack of coherent policymaking both at the national and institute levels, the digital divide that exists, the readiness of teachers and students in making the transition, the concern for special needs education and, finally, security concerns involved. It concludes with an assessment of the prospects for digital literacy and online teaching and learning in Malaysia. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Rajah Rasiah, Wah Yun Low, and Nurliana Kamaruddin;

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. Previously, Pranoto, Gunawan, and Soewito [1] had developed a logistic model for the purpose and the model was able to achieve 95% detection accuracy. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and fc-nearest neighbors classifiers. In addition, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method on the basis of the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 conversation texts of which 105 texts are grooming and 45 texts are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and fc-NN are able to identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification. © 2016 IEEE.","Grooming Classifier; k-nearest Neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Support Vector Machine","Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Computational costs; Detection accuracy; Detection system; Empirical studies; K-nearest neighbors; Nearest neighbors; Online Child Grooming; Computer crime","","","","","","","Pranoto H., Gunawan F.E., Soewito B., Logistic models for classifying online grooming conversation, Procedia Computer Science, 59, pp. 357-365, (2015); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrap-ping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Whittle H., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A., Collings G., A review of online grooming: Characteristics and concerns, Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18, 1, pp. 62-70, (2013); Soewito B., Isa S.M., Digital technology: The effect on connected world to computer ethic and family, CommIT (Communication and Information Technology).

One of the worst forms of cyber-security issues is child grooming, where sexual predators seek contact with minors to abuse them. Various types of organizations such as chat providers and law enforcement are inclined to find online predatory conversations in order to protect the children. This paper proposes a study on predatory conversation detection using Natural Language Processing. We analyzed the different types of features of online grooming data considering various characteristics of online conversation, such as psycho-linguistic patterns. Our experiments with online communication showed an accuracy of 0.98 in automatically classifying the conversations into predatory conversations and non-predatory conversations. Best results are obtained by using linear SVM on 1-gram features when removing stop words as well as by using multinomial Naïve Bayes on 1-gram features when not removing stop words. © 2019 IEEE.","","Cyber security; Linear SVM; Linguistic patterns; Multinomials; NAtural language processing; On-line communication; On-line network; Stop word; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Seto M.C., Pedophilia and sexual offenses against children, Annual Review of Sex Research, 15, 1, pp. 321-361, (2004); Craven S., Brown S., Gilchrist E., Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature and theoretical considerations, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 12, 3, pp. 287-299, (2006); Egan V., Hoskinson J., Shewan D., Perverted justice: A content analysis of the language used by offenders detected attempting to solicit children for sex, Antisocial Behavior: Causes, Correlations and Treatments, 20, 3, (2011); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF, 30, (2012); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC 2007), pp. 235-241, (2007); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes-Y Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Parapar J., Losada D.E., Barreiro A., A learning-based approach for the identification of sexual predators in chat logs, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Krzyzak A., Recognizing predatory chat documents using semi-supervised anomaly detection, Electronic Imaging, 2016, 17, pp. 1-9, (2016); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Sparck Jones K., A statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval, Journal of Documentation, 28, 1, pp. 11-21, (1972); Robertson S., Understanding inverse document frequency: On theoretical arguments for idf, Journal of Documentation, 60, 5, pp. 503-520, (2004); Zhang W., Yoshida T., Tang X., A comparative study of tf∗ idf, lsi and multi-words for text classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 3, pp. 2758-2765, (2011); Nijman H., Merckelbach H., Cima M., Performance intelligence, sexual offending and psychopathy, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 15, 3, pp. 319-330, (2009); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T.K., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Lorenzo-Dus N., Izura C., Cause ur special"": Understanding trust and complimenting behaviour in online grooming discourse, Journal of Pragmatics, 112, pp. 68-82, (2017); Joachims T., Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features, European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 137-142, (1998)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies, CSET 2019","27 October 2019 through 29 October 2019","Doha","155091","","978-172814538-9","","","English","Int.

CSA can happen in several places, such as schools, households, hostels, and other public spaces. However, a large number of people, including parents, do not have an awareness of this sensitive issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used in various disciplines in the modern era. Hence, supervised machine learning models have been used to predict child sexual abuse awareness in this study. The dataset contains answers provided by 3002 people regarding CSA. A questionnaire dataset obtained though crowdsourcing has been used to predict a person’s knowledge level regarding sexual abuse in children. Heterogenous ML and deep learning models have been used to make accurate predictions. To demystify the decisions made by the models, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have also been utilized. XAI helps in making the models more interpretable, decipherable, and transparent. Four XAI techniques: Shapley additive values (SHAP), Eli5, QLattice, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), have been utilized to demystify the models. Among all the classifiers, the final stacked model obtained the best results with an accuracy of 94% for the test dataset. The excellent results demonstrated by the classifiers point to the use of artificial intelligence in preventing child sexual abuse by making people aware of it. The models can be used real time in facilities such as schools, hospitals, and other places to increase awareness among people regarding sexual abuse in children. © The Author(s) 2023.","Artificial intelligence; Child sexual abuse; Child sexual abuse awareness; Explainable artificial intelligence; Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME); Shapley additive values (SHAP); Supervised machine learning","","","","","","","","Al-Shehari T., Alsowail R.A., An insider data leakage detection using one-hot encoding, synthetic minority oversampling and machine learning techniques, Entropy, 23, 10, (2021); Amrit C., Paauw T., Aly R., Lavric M., Identifying child abuse through text mining and machine learning, Expert Systems with Applications, 1, 88, pp. 402-418, (2017); Angelov P.P., Soares E.A., Jiang R., Arnold N.I., Atkinson P.M., Explainable artificial intelligence: An analytical review, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 11, 5, (2021); Arena S., Florian E., Zennaro I., Orru P.F., Sgarbossa F., A novel decision support system for managing predictive maintenance strategies based on machine learning approaches, Safety Science, 146, (2022); Assink M., van der Put C.E., Meeuwsen M.W., de Jong N.M., Oort F.J., Stams G.J., Hoeve M., Risk factors for child sexual abuse victimization: A meta-analytic review, Psychological Bulletin, 145, 5, (2019); Chadaga K., Prabhu S., Sampathila N., Chadaga R., Ks S., Sengupta S., Predicting cervical cancer biopsy results using demographic and epidemiological parameters: A custom stacked ensemble machine learning approach, Cogent Engineering, 9, 1, (2022); Christ C., De Waal M.M., Dekker J.J., van Kuijk I., Van Schaik D.J., Kikkert M.J., Goudriaan A.E., Beekman A.T., Messman-Moore T.L., Linking childhood emotional abuse and depressive symptoms: The role of emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems, PloS One, 14, 2, (2019); Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, .

Consequently, children are exposed to multifaceted threats, such as cyberbullying, grooming, and sexting. Although the online gaming industry is taking concerted measures to create a safe environment for children to play and interact with, such efforts remain inadequate and fragmented. There is a vital need to develop laws and policies to regulate and build minimum standards for the industry to safeguard and protect children online on the one hand, while promoting innovations in the gaming industry to preempt such threats. Many tools have been adapted to control threats against children in the form of content filtering and parental controls, thereby restricting contact with children to protect them from child predators. Different approaches utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to detect child predatory behavior have been designed to provide potential detection and protection in this context. In this paper, we survey online threats to children in the gaming environment and present the limitations of existing solutions that address these threats. We also aimed to present the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting children against predatory behavior by presenting a systematic review of the available techniques in the literature. Therefore, this analysis provides not only recommendations to stakeholders to develop policies and practices that safeguard children when gaming, but also to the gaming industry to continue providing appropriate measures for a safe and entertaining gaming environment. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; chat logs; child protection; cyberbullying; machine learning; online gaming; predatory threats","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computer crime; Consumer protection; E-learning; Learning systems; Online systems; Behavioral science; Censorship; Chat logs; Child protections; Cyber bullying; Game; Machine-learning; On-line gaming; Predatory threat; Face recognition","","","","","Rochester Institute of Technology's Academic Research Committee; Australian Research Council, ARC","This work was supported in part by the Grant from the Rochester Institute of Technology's Academic Research Committee (ARC).","Kemp S., Digital 2021, (2021); Stalker P., Livingstone S., Kardefelt-Winther D., Saeed M., Growing up in a connected world, (2019); Weru T., Sevilla J., Olukuru J., Mutegi L., Mberi T., Cybersmart children, cyber-safe teenagers: Enhancing internet safety for children, Proc.

Much research has been devoted to analyzing writing styles in handwritten, word-processed and online social networks (OSN) texts. Word processing editors that typically include spell and grammar checkers may influence the writing style as it allows an individual to edit a piece of text to perfection. Thus, similarities may exist between OSN and word-processed texts. Moreover, none of the studies to date have made a detailed comparison of the writing styles across multidisciplinary factors. This paper attempts to close the gap between the writing styles in pre- and post-Internet periods as well as provide an in-depth comparison of the writing styles in OSN texts across three major factors: demographics, personality behavior, and cybersecurity. The aim is to learn from past literature as we advance these techniques to OSN texts. Thus, in this paper, we also propose a novel machine learning prediction model based on tense morphology, to classify age and gender from English blogs, and the PAN 2013 dataset. This model achieves an accuracy of 94%-98% and 95%-97% for age and gender, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","Online social networks; survey; writing styles","Classification (of information); Word processing; Author identification; Cyber security; Grammar checkers; Major factors; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSN); Prediction model; Target audience; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Moerk E.L., Quantitative analysis of writing styles, J.

Timely detection of the objectionable content is very important for its prevention and reduction. This article explores and spotlights diversity of definitions of cyber-Aggression, cyberbulling, and cyber-grooming; analyzes current categorization systems and taxonomies; identifies the targets, target categories, and subcategories of the subjects of the objectionable content research; analyzes the ambiguity of the linguistic terms in the domain; reviews present databases gathered for researching the field; explores types of features used for modeling systems for automatic detection; and examines methods for automatic detection and/or prediction of the objectionable content. The results point to directions of system development for tracing transformations of objectionable content over time on different online social platforms.  © 2021 ACM.","automatic hate speech detection; Cyber-Aggression; cyber-grooming; cyber-predators; cyberbulluing","Computer crime; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; % reductions; Automatic Detection; Automatic hate speech detection; Cybe-aggression; Cybe-grooming; Cybe-predator; Cyber bullying; Cyberbulluing; Online social medias; Speech detection; Research challenges; Linguistics","","","","","","","Aggrawal N., 2018.

In this paper, we test the differences between subjects who report their true identity and the ones who give fake identity responding to control, simple, and complex questions. Asking complex questions is a new procedure for increasing liars' cognitive load, which is presented in this paper for the first time. The experiment consisted in an identity verification task, during which response time and errors were collected. Twenty participants were instructed to lie about their identity, whereas the other 20 were asked to respond truthfully. Different machine learning (ML) models were trained, reaching an accuracy level around 90-95% in distinguishing liars from truth tellers based on error rate and response time. Then, to evaluate the generalization and replicability of these models, a new sample of 10 participants were tested and classified, obtaining an accuracy between 80 and 90%. In short, results indicate that liars may be efficiently distinguished from truth tellers on the basis of their response times and errors to complex questions, with an adequate generalization accuracy of the classification models. © 2018 Monaro, Gamberini, Zecchinato and Sartori.","Complex questions; Deception detection; Faked identities; Lie detection; Reaction times","","","","","","","","Agosta S., Sartori G., The autobiographical IAT: a review, Front.

The usefulness of these systems depend on the quality of data that can be used for training. Data in the domain are scarce, sensitive, and emotionally taxing for annotators. NLP researchers approximate victimization conversations using transcripts from internet stings performed by either vigilantes or LEOs, with an implicit assumption that vigilante or LEO conversations represent the victimization process. Psychology research, however, states that underage victim chats differ from internet stings in goal and modus operandi. We present a methodology and observations from annotating a corpus of victim, vigilante, and LEO conversations with convicted predators with the goal of comparing these chats. The corpus is annotated for stages and tactics of the victimization process described within psychology research. As predicted by psychological research, we found significant differences in the three classes of chats that are usually not taken into account in chat classification. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Law enforcement officers; Modus operandi; Psychological research; Quality of data; Victimisation; Crime","","","","","","","Aitken Susan, Gaskell Danielle, Hodkinson Alan, Online sexual grooming: exploratory comparison of themes arising from male offenders' communications with male victims compared to female victims, Deviant Behavior, 39, 9, pp. 1170-1190, (2018); Albahar Marwan, Almalki Jameel, Deep-fakes: Threats and countermeasures systematic review, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 97, 22, pp. 3242-3250, (2019); Bada Michael, Eckert Miriam, Evans Donald, Garcia Kristin, Shipley Krista, Sitnikov Dmitry, Baumgartner William A., Bretonnel Cohen K., Verspoor Karin, Blake Judith A., Et al., Concept annotation in the craft corpus, BMC Bioinformatics, 13, 1, (2012); Barber Connie, Bettez Silvia, Deconstructing the online grooming of youth: Toward improved information systems for detection of online sexual predators, (2014); Bayerl Petra S, Lungen Harald, Gut Ulrike, Paul Karsten I, Methodology for reliable schema development and evaluation of manual annotations, Proceedings of the Workshop on Knowledge Markup and Semantic Annotation at the Second International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2003), (2003); Bayerl Petra Saskia, Paul Karsten Ingmar, What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations? a meta-analytic investigation, Computational Linguistics, 37, 4, pp. 699-725, (2011); Beauregard Eric, Leclerc Benoit, Lussier Patrick, Decision making in the crime commission process: Comparing rapists, child molesters, and victim-crossover sex offenders, Criminal Justice and Behavior, 39, 10, pp. 1275-1295, (2012); Bergen Emilia, Antfolk Jan, Jern Patrick, Alanko Katarina, Santtila Pekka, Adults' sexual interest in children and adolescents online: A quasi-experimental study, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 7, 2, (2013); Black Pamela J, Wollis Melissa, Woodworth Michael, Hancock Jeffrey T, A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child abuse & neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Bogdanova Dasha, Rosso Paolo, Solorio Thamar, On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd workshop in computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Bowen Glenn A, Naturalistic inquiry and the saturation concept: a research note, Qualitative research, 8, 1, pp. 137-152, (2008); Briggs Peter, Simon Walter T, Simonsen Stacy, An exploratory study of internet-initiated sexual offenses and the chat room sex offender: Has the internet enabled a new typology of sex offender?, Sexual Abuse, 23, 1, pp. 72-91, (2011); Cano Amparo Elizabeth, Fernandez Miriam, Alani Harith, Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International conference on social informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Chiang Emily, Grant Tim, Deceptive identity performance: offender moves and multiple identities in online child abuse conversations, Applied Linguistics, 40, 4, pp. 675-698, (2019); Colton Matthew, Roberts Susan, Van-stone Maurice, Sexual abuse by men who work with children, Journal of child sexual abuse, 19, 3, pp. 345-364, (2010); DeHart Dana, Dwyer Gregg, Seto Michael C, Moran Robert, Letourneau Elizabeth, Schwarz-Watts Donna, Internet sexual solicitation of children: a proposed typology of offenders based on their chats, e-mails, and social network posts, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 23, 1, pp. 77-89, (2017); Diaz Maria, Panangadan Anand, Natural language-based integration of online review datasets for identification of sex trafficking businesses, 2020 IEEE 21st International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI), pp. 259-264, (2020); Ebrahimi Mohammadreza, Suen Ching Y, Ormandjieva Olga, Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); van Gijn-Grosvenor Evianne L., Lamb Michael E., Behavioural differences between online sexual groomers approaching boys and girls, Journal of Child Sexual Abuse, 25, 5, pp. 577-596, (2016); Gillespie Alisdair A, Child protection on the internet-challenges for criminal law, Child & Fam.

The research incorporates analysis of chat logs from convicted felons, to generate a dictionary of sexual approach words. By analysing data across multiple social networks, the study demonstrates the usefulness of such a dictionary of approach words in detection of online predatory behaviour through machine learning algorithms. It also shows the difference between the nature of contents across specific social network platforms. The proposed solution to detect cyberbullying and the domain of approach words are scalable to fit real-life social media, which can have a positive impact on the overall health of online social networks. Different types of cyberbullying have different characteristics. However, existing cyberbullying detection works are not targeted towards any of these specific types. This research is tailored to focus on sexual harassment type of cyberbullying and proposes a novel dictionary of approach words. Since cyberbullying is a growing threat to the mental health and intellectual development of adolescents in the society, models targeted towards the detection of specific type of online bullying or predation should be encouraged among social network researchers.  © 2021 Syed Mahbub et al.","","Computer crime;

However, it has not yet been settled what causes this variation, and several factors have been proposed in the literature, including internet habituation, individualism, and uncertainty avoidance. Here we investigate these factors by two studies. In the first, we examine the association between online privacy concerns and a new measure of online self-disclosure norms that we introduce. We find that this measure is significantly associated with two established instruments of online privacy concerns in the literature. In the second, we analyze previously unpublished data from a questionnaire on online self-disclosure norms as assessed by this new measure. It includes replies from 18,046 adult respondents from 57 countries and six continents. We find that norms in favor of more restrictive online self-disclosure are weaker in countries with higher levels of internet penetration (r = −0.56, p < .001). Our findings suggest that higher internet penetration in a country reduces online privacy concerns. The results support the idea that habituation to online environments decreases privacy risk perceptions. An implication is that preferences for online privacy are likely to decline over time in countries where internet penetration is still low. Lastly, in conflict with previous studies, our analyses do not support the theory that online privacy concerns are associated with national cultures related to individualism or uncertainty avoidance as measured by Hofstede's indices. © 2023 The Authors","Cultural variation; Hofstede; Individualism; Internet penetration; Privacy concerns; Self-disclosure norms; Uncertainty avoidance","","","","","","Bernardo Manhique; Harry Manley; SwedishFoundation for Humanities and Social Sciences; WASP-HS; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ, (P17–0030:1); Marcus och Amalia Wallenbergs minnesfond, MAW","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program – Humanities and Society (WASP-HS) funded by the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation , and the SwedishFoundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond) [grant no.

We use 3 different approaches (message-based, author-based and conversation-based) combined with 5 different classification algorithms and 2 different features sets. The best results were obtained using either the author-based approach with the Neural Network classifier on the TF-IDF feature set, or the conversation-based approach using the Ridge or the Naïve Bayes classifier on the TF-IDF feature set. In this paper, for the first time, we looked at how quick a predator could be detected, and found that in most cases 26-161 messages of a conversation were sufficient. This constitutes only a small fraction of the full conversations, showing that we can have an early detection system of sexual predators instead of knowing in retrospect that a child was the victim of a sexual predator. © 2019 IEEE.","","Social networking (online); Bayes Classifier; Classification algorithm; Early detection system; Feature sets; Features sets; Neural network classifier; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Ngejane C.H., Mabuza-Hocquet G., Eloff J.H.P., Lefophane S., Mitigating online sexual grooming cybercrime on social media using machine learning: A desktop survey, 2018 International Conference on Advances in Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (IcABCD), pp. 1-6, (2018); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC, pp. 235-241, (2007); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at PAN-2012, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, (2012); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes-Y-Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, (2012); Eriksson G., Karlgren J., Features for modelling characteristics of conversations, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop, Online Working Notes, (2012); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Pandey S.J., Klapaftis I., Manandhar S., Detecting predatory behaviour from online textual chats, Multimedia Communications, Services and Security, pp. 270-281, (2012); Gunawan F.E., Ashianti L., Candra S., Soewito B., Detecting online child grooming conversation, 2016 11th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS), pp. 1-6, (2016); Jurafsky D., Martin J.H., Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition, (2009); Bishop C.M., Pattern Recognition Machine Learning, (2006); McDonald G.C., Ridge regression, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics, 1, 1, pp. 93-100, (2009); Van Gerven M., Bohte S.M., Editorial: Artificial neural networks as models of neural information processing, Front.

In particular, adults and minors are able to exchange sexually explicit messages and media via a variety of online platforms that are widely available, which leads to an increasing concern of child grooming. Traditionally, the identification of child grooming relies on the analysis and localisation of conversation texts, but this is usually time-consuming and associated with other implications such as psychological pressure on the investigators. Therefore, automatic methods to detect grooming conversations have attracted the attention of many researchers. This paper proposes such a system to identify child grooming in online chat conversations, where the training data of the system were harvested from publicly available information. The data processing is based on a group of AI technologies, including fuzzy-rough feature selection and fuzzy twin support vector machine. Evaluation shows the promise of the proposed approach in identifying online grooming conversations to be implemented in the future after further development to support real-world cases. © 2019 IEEE.","","Data handling;

For their education, children require access to the internet, as well as a standard institutional ICT infrastructure, including e-mail and other forms of online communication technology. Given the sheer volume of data being generated and shared on a daily basis within schools, most teachers and DSLs can no longer monitor the safety and wellbeing of their students without the use of specialist safeguarding software. In this paper, we experiment with the use of stateof-the-art neural network models on the modelling of a dataset of almost 9,000 anonymised child-generated chat messages on the Microsoft Teams platform. The dataset was manually annotated into two binary classes: true positives (real safeguarding concerns) and false positives (false alarms) that a monitoring program would be interested in. These classes were then further annotated into eight fine-grained classes of safeguarding concerns (or false alarms). For the binary classification, we achieved a macro F1 score of 87.32, while for the fine-grained classification, our models achieved a macro F1 score of 73.56. This first experiment into the use of Deep Learning for detecting safeguarding concerns represents an important step towards achieving high-accuracy and reliable monitoring information for busy teachers and safeguarding leads. © 2023 Incoma Ltd.

This study focuses on grammatical ambiguous sentences, grammatical ambiguous sentences are ambiguities that occur due to incorrect grammar, but this ambiguity will disappear once it is used within a sentence. Ambiguous sentences become a big problem when they are processed by a computer. In order for the computer to interpret ambiguous words correctly, this study seeks to develop detection of Indonesian ammbiguous sentences using Boyer Moore algorithm. This algorithm matches ambiguous sentences that are inserted as input with the data set. Then the sentence is being detected whether it contains ambiguous sentences, by calculating the percentage of similarity using cosine similarity method. Cosine similarity system is able to find out the meaning of the sentence. In the data set, the number of ambiguous sentences that can be collected is 50 words. The 50 words consist of ambiguous words data, ambiguous sentences, and ambiguous sentence meanings. This system trial was carried out for 200 times and the accuracy level was 0.935, precision was 0.9320, and Recall was 0.8. While the F-Measure was 0.8061. While the speed for word search 0.003275 seconds. © 2020, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.","Ambiguous; Boyer-Moore; Grammatical; Indonesian sentences; String; Text","","","","","","","","Charina I.N., Lexical and Syntactic Ambiguity in Humor, International Journal of Humanity Studies, 1, 1, pp. 120-131, (2017);

Our mix-method study, comprised of an online survey, five FGDs, and 20 semi-structured interviews in Bangladesh, investigates the common nature, location, and time of the abuse, post-incident support, and possible combating strategies. Besides revealing important facts, our findings highlight the need of decentering the design from the victims (children and/or guardians) to the community. Hence, building on the theory of transformative justice, we prototyped and evaluated 'ShishuShurokkha' - an online tool that involves the whole community by allowing anonymous bystander reporting, visualizing case-maps, connecting with legal, medical, and social support, and raising awareness. The evaluation of ShishuShurokkha shows the promise for such a communal approach toward combating child sexual abuse, and highlights the needs for sincere involvement of the government, NGOs, the legal, educational, and religious services in this. © 2022 ACM.","Bangladesh; Child Sexual abuse; Community Driven Design; Gender Harassment; Shame; ShishuShurokkha; Social Media; Solidarity; Transformative Justice","Computer programming; Bangladesh; Child sexual abuse; Community driven design; Gender harassment; Online surveys; Shame; Shishushurokkha; Social media; Solidarity; Transformative justice; Social networking (online)","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (-2018-0); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (892191082); Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI, (37608); Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science, MRIS","This research was made possible by the generous grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (#RGPIN-2018-0), Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (#892191082), Canada Foundation for Innovation (#37608), Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (#37608), International Fulbright Centennial Fellowship of Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, and Facebook Fellowship of Sharifa Sultana.","Ericsson A.B., Stewards of Children Prevention Toolkit on the App Store, (2021); Abebe R., Goldner K., Mechanism design for social good, Ai Matters, 4, 3, pp. 27-34, (2018); Abras C., Maloney-Krichmar D., Preece J., Et al., User-centered design, Bainbridge, W.

Over the last few years, the rate of online grooming has seen a massive increase along with an increase in the number of teenage users. The proposed system, Prevention of Emotional Entrapment of Children (PEEC), consists of an age detection module using Deep Neural Network (DNN) as well as a grooming detection module using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to monitor the conversations of only those users who come under the category of minor (below 18). The resultant system gave an accuracy of 84% for age detection and 91% for grooming detection. © 2021 IEEE.","child harassment; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA); Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC); Online grooming; paedophilia","Deep neural networks; Statistics; Support vector machines; Child harassment; Detection modules; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Linguistic inquiry and word count; Online grooming; Pedophilia; Pressung; Social media; Support vectors machine; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Bretschneider U., Wohner T., Peters R., Detecting Online Harassment in Social Networks; Williams R., Elliott I.A., Beech A.R., Identifying sexual grooming themes used by internet sex offenders, Deviant Behavior; Zuo Z., Li J., Anderson P., Yang L., Grooming detection using fuzzy-rough feature selection and text classification, Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); Jonsson L.S., Fredlund C., Priebe G., Wadsby M., Svedin C.G., Online sexual abuse of adolescents by a perpetrator met online: A cross-sectional study, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, (); Dombrowski S.C., LeMasney J.W., Ahia C.E., Dickson S.A., Protecting children from online sexual predators:technological, psychoeduca-tional, and legal considerations, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, (); Gupta A., Kumaraguru P., Sureka A., Characterizing Pedophile Conversations on the Internet Using Online Grooming; Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International Conference on Social Informatics; Van Loo De J., De Pauw G., Daelemans W., Text-based age and gender prediction for online safety monitoring, International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics (IJCSDF); Tam J., Martell C.H., Age detection in chat, Ieee International Conference on Semantic Computing; Pentel A., Effect of different feature types on age based classification of short texts, Th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA), Corfu; Ashcroft M., Kaati L., Meyer M., A step towards detecting online grooming-identifying adults pretending to be children, European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference, Manchester; Pandya A., Oussalah M., Monachesi P., Kostakos P., Loven L., On the use of urls and hashtags in age prediction of twitter users, Ieee International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI), Salt Lake City, Ut; Guimaraes R.G., Rosa R.L., De Gaetano D., Rodriguez D.Z., Bressan G., Age groups classification in social network using deep learning, Ieee Access; Adams P.H., Martell C.H., Topic detection and extraction in chat, Ieee International Conference on Semantic Computing; Vartapetiance A., Gillam L., Our little secret"": Pinpointing potential predators, Security Informatics; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET); Anderson P., Zuo Z., Yang L., Qu Y., An intelligent online grooming detection system using ai technologies, Ieee International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE); Cardei C., Rebeda T., Detecting sexual predators in chats using behavioral features and imbalanced learning, Natural Language Engineering; Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, Th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), Porto, Portugal; Munoz F., Isaza G., Castillo L., Smartseccop: Smart cyber-grooming detection using natural language processing and convolutional neural networks, Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Th International Conference; Zambrano P., Torres J., Tello-Oquendo L., Jacome R., Benalcazar M.E., Andrade R., Fuertes W., Technical mapping of the grooming anatomy using machine learning paradigms: An information security approach, Ieee Access; Perverted-justice.com-the Largest and Best Anti-Predator Organization Online; Non-Grooming Conversations; Abusive and Sexual Conversations between Adults","","Mallenahalli N.; Bhattacharya A.; Senatore S.; Negi A.; Hirose A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Mahindra University","2021 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence, ICETCI 2021","25 August 2021 through 27 August 2021","Virtual, Hyderabad","173182","","978-166541559-0","","","English","Proc.

As online communities grow, they place a greater burden on their human moderators, which increases the likelihood that people at risk may be overlooked. This study evaluated the potential for machine learning to assist online peer support by directing moderators' attention where it is most needed. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of an automated triage system and the extent to which it influences moderator behavior. Methods: A machine learning classifier was trained to prioritize forum messages as green, amber, red, or crisis depending on how urgently they require attention from a moderator. This was then launched as a set of widgets injected into a popular online peer support forum hosted by ReachOut.com, an Australian Web-based youth mental health service that aims to intervene early in the onset of mental health problems in young people. The accuracy of the system was evaluated using a holdout test set of manually prioritized messages. The impact on moderator behavior was measured as response ratio and response latency, that is, the proportion of messages that receive at least one reply from a moderator and how long it took for these replies to be made. These measures were compared across 3 periods: before launch, after an informal launch, and after a formal launch accompanied by training. Results: The algorithm achieved 84% f-measure in identifying content that required a moderator response. Between prelaunch and post-training periods, response ratios increased by 0.9, 4.4, and 10.5 percentage points for messages labelled as crisis, red, and green, respectively, but decreased by 5.0 percentage points for amber messages. Logistic regression indicated that the triage system was a significant contributor to response ratios for green, amber, and red messages, but not for crisis messages. Response latency was significantly reduced (P<.001), between the same periods, by factors of 80%, 80%, 77%, and 12% for crisis, red, amber, and green messages, respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the triage system made a significant and unique contribution to reducing the time taken to respond to green, amber, and red messages, but not to crisis messages, after accounting for moderator and community activity. Conclusions: The triage system was generally accurate, and moderators were largely in agreement with how messages were prioritized. It had a modest effect on response ratios, primarily because moderators were already more likely to respond to high priority content before the introduction of triage. However, it significantly and substantially reduced the time taken for moderators to respond to prioritized content. Further evaluations are needed to assess the impact of mistakes made by the triage algorithm and how changes to moderator responsiveness impact the well-being of forum members. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Challenges in defining online sexual grooming, variations in its prevalence, and evolving offender strategies necessitate a cohesive global legislative effort to combat child sexual abuse. This study employs a legal and psychological perspective, utilizing an integrative review methodology to comprehensively understand online sexual grooming. The objective is to formulate a holistic risk prevention and management framework. Examining risk and vulnerability identification mechanisms through empirical research, the study advocates for an integrated approach, encompassing psychosocial and preventive strategies to combat cybercrime. The proposed framework, comprising primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention measures, aims to strengthen the global fight against the disturbing phenomenon of online sexual grooming and its detrimental impact on children, adolescents, and society as a whole. © 2024, IGI Global.

It is a challenging bullying problem occurring in a new territory. Online bullying can be particularly damaging and upsetting because it's usually anonymous or hard to trace. In this paper, the proposed method is utilizing a dataset of real world conversations (i.e. Pairs of questions and answers between cyber predator and the victim), in which each predator question is manually annotated in terms of severity using a numeric label. We approach the issue as a sequential data modelling approach, in which the predator's questions are formulated using a Singular Value Decomposition representation. The motivation of this procedure is to study the accuracy of predicting the level of cyber bullying attack using classification methods and also to examine potential patterns between the lingustic style of each predator. More specifically, unlike previous approaches that consider a fixed window of a cyber-predator's questions within a dialogue, we exploit the whole question set and model it as a signal, whose magnitude depends on the degree of bullying content. Using feature weighting and dimensionality reduction techniques, each signal is straightforwardly parsed by a neural network that forecasts the level of insult within a question given a window between two and three previous questions. Throughout the time series modeling experiments, an interesting discovery was made. By applying SVD on the time series data and taking into account the second dimension (since the first is usually modeling trivial dependencies between instances and attributes) we observed that its plot was very similar to the plot of the class attribute. By applying a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, the similarity of the aforementioned signals was proved to exist, providing an immediate indicator for the severity of cyber bullying within a given dialogue. © 2014 IEEE.","cyberbullying; Dynamic time warping; singular value decomposition; SVM feature selection; time series analysis","Computer crime; Data mining; Personal digital assistants; Singular value decomposition; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Communication technologies; Cyber bullying; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Dynamic time warping; Dynamic time warping algorithms; Feature weighting; Time series modeling; Time series analysis","","","","","","","The National Crime Prevention; Willard N.E., Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats: Responding to the Challenge of Online Social Aggression, Threats, and Distress, (2007); Cambria E., Wang H., White B., Guest editorial: Big social data analysis, Knowledge-Based Systems, 69, pp. 1-2, (2014); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop-Working Notes Papers, (2012); Xue Y.Z., Hong L., Davison B.D., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Detection of Harassment on Web 2.0 in CAW 2.0 '09: Proceedings of the 1st Content Analysis in Web 2.0 Workshop, (2009); Kontostathis A., Reynolds K., Garron A., Edwards L., Detecting cyberbullying: Query terms and techniques, Proceedings of the 5th Annual Acm Web Science Conference, pp. 195-204, (2013); Kontostathis A., West W., Garron A., Reynolds K., Edwards L., Identifying Predators Using Chatcoder 2.0-notebook for Pan at Clef, (2012); Lau R., Xia Y Ye.

This provides a platform to connect, to share and to transfer knowledge. Every user gives enough of individual information in their record, for example, name, age, gender, email-Id, phone number, current town, profession, educational details, movies, sports, likes and dislikes, current location and so forth. Some users (cyber predators) use these information's against the adolescents to harass them over the Internet in an illegal and deceptive way. Adolescents are easy target for the cyber predators, because they easily believe on others. Adolescents find someone trustworthy and start sharing their personal information. In this research work, we conducted a survey on adolescents. We tried to establish a relationship amongst cyber bullying, trust and level of information shared and with the help of this we figured out the root cause of cyber bullying. We also calculated the degree of cyber bullying in the adolescents with respect to different level of shared information. © 2015 IEEE.","Cyber bullying; Cyber predator; Cyber victim; Information shared; Social Networking Sites (SNS); Trust","Information use; Cyber bullying; Cyber predator; Cyber victim; Information shared; Social networking sites; Trust; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Hosseinmardi H., Han R., Lv Q., Mishra S., Towards understanding cyberbullying behavior in a semianonymous social network, 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014); Patchin J.W., Hinduja S., Bullies move beyond the schoolyard; A preliminary look at cyberbullying, Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice, 4, 2, (2006); Glossary of Cyberbullying Terms.

Evidently, current research is primarily focused on its technological development. However, involving adolescents' voices regarding the desirability of this monitoring is important; particularly because automatic monitoring might invade adolescents' privacy and freedom, and consequently evoke reactance. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N = 66) between 12 and 18 years old. The goal was to obtain insights into adolescents' opinions on desirability and priorities for automatically detecting harmful content on SNSs. Opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of freedom. Most adolescents in this study are in favour of automatic monitoring for situations they perceive as uncontrollable or that they cannot solve themselves. Clear priorities for detection must be set in order to ensure the privacy and autonomy of adolescents. Moreover, monitoring actions aiming at the prevention of harm are required. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescents; Automatic monitoring; Online protection; Qualitative research; Social networking sites","","","","","","Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology; Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie, IWT, (120007)","This work was supported by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) under Grant 120007 .

The research reported here contributes to the growing body of work within linguistics that has found experimental methods to be useful in answering questions about representation and constraints on linguistic expression (Hemforth 2013). The wider project examines online identity assumption in online paedophile activity and the policing of such activity, and involves dealing with the linguistic analysis of highly sensitive sexual grooming transcripts. Within the linguistics portion of the project, we examine theories of idiolect and identity through analysis of the 'talk' of perpetrators of online sexual abuse, and of the undercover officers that must assume alternative identities in order to investigate such crimes. The essential linguistic question in this article is methodological and concerns the applicability of experimental work to exploration of online identity and identity disguise. Although we touch on empirical questions, such as the sufficiency of linguistic description that will enable convincing identity disguise, we do not explore the experimental results in detail. In spite of the preference within a range of discourse analytical paradigms for 'naturally occurring' data, we argue that not only does the term prove conceptually problematic, but in certain contexts, and particularly in the applied forensic context described, a rejection of experimentally elicited data would limit the possible types and extent of analyses. Thus, it would restrict the contribution that academic linguistics can make in addressing a serious social problem. © 2016 Oxford University Press.","","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/L003279/1)","","Al-Sadi R.A., Hamdan J.M., Synchronous online chat' English: Computer mediated communication, World Englishes, 24, 4, pp. 409-424, (2005);

However, whether SECC should be defined as a separate criminal act and the legal conditions of punishment in the current criminal law systems are completely ignored. © 2016 International Journal of Cyber Criminology (IJCC).","Cyber crime; Online child sexual abuse; Policing; Raising awareness; Sextortion; Sexual extortion","","","","","","","","Baker C.N., Sexual Extortion: Criminalizing Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Law & Ineq, 13, (1994); Briggs F., Hawkins R.M., Follow-up data on the effectiveness of New Zealand's national school based child protection program, Child abuse & neglect, 18, 8, pp. 635-643, (1994); Butler D., Kift S., Campbell M., Cyber bullying in schools and the law: Is there an effective means of addressing the power imbalance, eLaw J, 16, (2009); Butterfield L., NetSafe: the New Zealand model for Internet (ICT) safety education, (2002); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting Child Grooming Behaviour Patterns on Social Media, International Conference on Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach, American sociological review, 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); Cole H., Griffiths M.D., Social interactions in massively multiplayer online role-playing gamers, CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10, 4, pp. 575-583, (2007); Davidson J.C., Martellozzo E., Educating children about sexual abuse and evaluating the Metropolitan Police Safer Surfing Programme, (2004); Davidson J., Martellozzo E., Lorenz M., Evaluation of CEOP ThinkUKnow internet safety programme and exploration of young people's internet safety knowledge, (2009); Dombrowski S.C., LeMasney J.W., Ahia C.E., Dickson S.A., Protecting Children From Online Sexual Predators: Technological, Psychoeducational, and Legal Considerations, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 35, 1, (2004); Edwards A., Judge calls child exploiter a 'narcissistic demon, ' hands down 30-year sentence, (2010); Ellison N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, 1, pp. 210-230, (2007); The Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) 2015, (2015); Goodno N., Cyberstalking, a new crime: Evaluating the effectiveness of current state and federal laws, Missouri Law Review, (2007); Haden S.C., Scarpa A., Jones R.T., Ollendick T.H., Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury: The moderating role of perceived social support and coping for young adults, Personality and Individual Differences, 42, 7, pp. 1187-1198, (2007); Hadnagy C., Social engineering: The art of human hacking, (2010); Terminology Guidelines for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, (2016); Joyce M., Video Chat Extortion and Sexual Abuse, Korean Source, 122, pp. 20-32, (2012); Kerlikowske R.G., Wilson M., NetSmartz: a comprehensive approach to internet safety and awareness, Police Chief, 74, 4, (2007); Konrad K.A., Skaperdas S., Credible threats in extortion, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 33, 1, pp. 23-39, (1997); Kopecky K., Hejsek L., Kusa J., Maresova H., Rerichova V., Specifics of children communication and online aggressors within the online assaults on children (analysis of selected utterances), SGEM2015 Conference Proceedings, pp. 195-202, (2015); Kopecky K., Strucnỳ úvod do problematiky online vydírání ceskỳch detí se zamerením na tzv. sextortion, Pediatrie pro Praxi, 15, 6, pp. 352-354, (2014); Krone T., A typology of online child pornography offending, (2004); Leary M.G., Sexting or Self-Produced Child-Pornography-The Dialog Continues-Structured Prosecutorial Discretion within a Multidisciplinary Response, Va.

Due to the prevalence of the online conversations, mitigating the undesirable effects of child abuse in cyber space has become inevitable. Using automatic ways to combat this kind of crime is challenging and demands efficient and scalable data mining techniques. The problem can be casted as a combination of textual preprocessing in data/text mining and pattern classification in machine learning. This chapter covers different data mining methods including preprocessing, feature extraction and the popular ways of feature enrichment through extracting sentiments and emotional features. A brief tutorial on classification algorithms in the domain of automated predator identification is also presented through the chapter. Finally, the discussion is summarized and the challenges and open issues in this application domain are discussed. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Cyber-stalking and online bullying can have devastating effects on individuals, but it's affecting the workplace too. In response, relevant technology could be used to counteract and mitigate the damage caused by online perpetrators. Haider M al-Khateeb and Gregory Epiphaniou of the University of Bedfordshire approach this issue using an incident response methodology and discuss the role of machine learning to identify and classify such attacks. They also examine how digital forensic investigations can be carried out in order to analyse the nature of the offence and preserve evidence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Attack vector; Devastating effects; Digital forensic; Incident response; Social life; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Maple C., Short E., Brown A., Bryden C., Salter M., Cyberstalking in the UK: Analysis and Recommendations, International Journal of Distributed Systems and Technologies (IJDST), 3, 4, pp. 34-51, (2012); Short E., Linford S., Wheatcroft J.M., Maple C., The Impact of Cyberstalking: The Lived Experience-A Thematic Analysis, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 199, pp. 133-137, (2014); Gupta A., Kumaraguru P., Sureka A., 'Characterizing Pedophile Conversations on the Internet Using Online Grooming', (2012); Dinakar K., Reichart R., Lieberman H., 'Modeling the Detection of Textual Cyberbullying'. in the Social Mobile Web, (2011); Dadvar M., Trieschnigg D., De Jong F., Experts and Machines against Bullies: A Hybrid Approach to Detect Cyberbullies, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 275-281, (2014); Cano A.E., Fernandez M., Alani H., Detecting Child Grooming Behaviour Patterns on Social Media, Social Informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Fahrnberger G., Nayak D., Martha V.S., Ramaswamy S., SafeChat: A tool to shield children's communication from explicit messages, Innovations for Community Services (I4CS), 14th International Conference, (2014); Burmester M., Henry P., Kermes L.S., Tracking cyberstalkers: A cryptographic approach, ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society, 35, 3, (2005); Amuchi F., Al-Nemrat A., Alazab M., Layton R., Identifying cyber predators through forensic authorship analysis of chat logs, Cybercrime and Trustworthy Computing Workshop (CTC), (2012); Satta R., Stirparo P., Picture-to-identity linking of social network accounts based on sensor pattern noise, 5th International Conference on Imaging for Crime Detection and Prevention (ICDP 2013), (2013); Van Der Zwaan J., Dignum M., Jonker C., Simulating peer support for victims of cyberbullying'., BNAIC 2010: 22rd Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Luxembourg; Dinakar K., Jones B., Lieberman H., Picard R., Rose C., Thoman M., Reichart R.

Traditionally, chatbot technology is built under certain set of “manually” elaborated conversational rules. However, given the availability of large and real examples of humans’ interactions in the web, automatically generating these rules is becoming a more feasible option. In this paper we describe an approach for building and training a conversational agent, which holds a teenager personality and it is able to dialogue in Mexican Spanish. By means of this chatter bot we aim at assisting law enforcement officers in the prevention of cyber-pedophilia. Our performed experiments demonstrate that our developed chatbot is able to elaborate comparable lexical and syntactical constructions to those a teenager would produce. As an additional contribution, we compile and release a large dialogue corpus containing real examples of conversations among teenagers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Conversational agent; Cyber-pedophilia; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora; Natural language processing","Linguistics; Speech processing; Conversational agents; Cyber-pedophilia; Dialog systems; Dialogue corpora; NAtural language processing; Conversational systems; Dialogue systems; Law enforcement officers; Natural languages; Natural language processing systems","","","","","Language Technologies Thematic Network, (260178, 271622); Thematic Networks program; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Acknowledgments.

With manual inspections becoming increasingly infeasible, law enforcement bodies are optimising online investigations through data-mining technologies. Such technologies must be well designed and rigorously grounded, yet no survey of the online data-mining literature exists which examines their techniques, applications and rigour. This article remedies this gap through a systematic mapping study describing online data-mining literature which visibly targets law enforcement applications, using evidence-based practices in survey making to produce a replicable analysis which can be methodologically examined for deficiencies. © 2015 ACM.","Cybercrime; Law enforcement; Literature review; Online data mining; Opensource intelligence; OSINT; Systematic survey","Computer crime; Environmental regulations; Law enforcement; Surveys; Cybercrime; Literature reviews; Online data; Open-source; OSINT; Data mining","","","","","","","Abbasi A., Affect intensity analysis of dark web forums, Intelligence and Security Informatics 2007 IEEE, pp. 282-288, (2007); Abbasi A., Chen H., Applying authorship analysis to extremist-group web forum messages, Intelligent Systems IEEE, pp. 67-75, (2005); Abbasi A., Chen H., Writeprints: A stylometric approach to identity-level identification and similarity detection in cyberspace, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 26, 2, (2008); Abbasi A., Chen H., Salem A., Sentiment analysis in multiple languages: Feature selection for opinion classification in web forums, ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 26, 3, (2008); (2013); Afroz S., Caliskan-Islam A., Stolerman A., Greenstadt R., McCoy D., Doppelg änger finder: Taking stylometry to the underground, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

Providers and law enforcement tend to use these huge logs anonymously for automatic online Sexual Predator Identification (SPI) which is a relatively new area of application. The task plays an important role in protecting children and juveniles against being exploited by online predators. Pattern recognition techniques facilitate automatic identification of harmful conversations in cyber space by law enforcements. These techniques usually require a large volume of high-quality training instances of both predatory and non-predatory documents. However, collecting non-predatory documents is not practical in real-world applications, since this category contains a large variety of documents with many topics including politics, sports, science, technology and etc. We utilized a new semi-supervised approach to mitigate this problem by adapting an anomaly detection technique called One-class Support Vector Machine which does not require non-predatory samples for training. We compared the performance of this approach against other state-of-the-art methods which use both positive and negative instances. We observed that although anomaly detection approach utilizes only one class label for training (which is a very desirable property in practice); its performance is comparable to that of binary SVM classification. In addition, this approach outperforms the classic two-class Naïve Bayes algorithm, which we used as our baseline, in terms of both classification accuracy and precision. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.","","Automation; Information retrieval; Law enforcement; Pattern recognition; Selenium compounds; Support vector machines; Automatic identification; Bayes algorithms; Classification accuracy; Detection approach; Negative instances; One-class support vector machine; Pattern recognition techniques; State-of-the-art methods; Anomaly detection","","","","","","","Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at PAN-2012, CLEF (working Notes), (2012); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes-Y-Gomez M., Villasenor-Pineda L., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, Rome, (2012); Morris C., Identifying online sexual predators by SVM classification with lexical and behavioral features, Master of Science Thesis, (2013); Pendar N., Toward Spotting the Pedophile Telling Victim from Predator in Text Chats, pp. 235-241, (2007); Kontostathis A., Toward the tracking and categorization of internet predators, Proceeding of Text Mining Workshop 2009 Held in Conjunction With Ninth Siam International Conference Data Mining, (2009); Mcghee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Mcbride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, Int.

This paper presents a privacy protection protocol in order to protect users from risks that may be encountered in their social networks activities. In particular, we focus on the sexual predators detection. For this purpose, we use text mining tools to classify doubtful conversations based on lexical and behavioral features extraction. Moreover, we are able to flag potential predators, by computing the predatorhood score according to the sum of features weights. Different experiments have been carried out based on comparative study between two machine learning algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and Naãŕve Bayes (NB). The results are very promising. © 2016 ACM.","Community detection; Machine learning; Predators; Privacy protection; Security; Social networks; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Data mining; Internet; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Personal computing; Support vector machines; Community detection; Predators; Privacy protection; Security; Text mining; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Aleman Y., Vilarino D., Pinto D., Searching Sexual Predators in Social Networks; Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Modelling fixated discourse in chats with cyberpedophiles, Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Deception Detection, pp. 86-90, (2012); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop in Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Escalante H.J., LabTL I., Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez A., Montes-Y Gomez M., Sexual predator detection in chats with chained classifiers, WASSA 2013, (2013); Inches G., Crestani F., Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at pan-2012, CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), 30, (2012); McGhee I., Bayzick J., Kontostathis A., Edwards L., McBride A., Jakubowski E., Learning to identify internet sexual predation, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 3, pp. 103-122, (2011); Michalopoulos D., Mavridis I., Utilizing document classification for grooming attack recognition, Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2011 IEEE Symposium On, pp. 864-869, (2011); Morris C., Identifying Online Sexual Predators by SVM Classification with Lexical and Behavioral Features, (2013); Pendar N., Toward spotting the pedophile telling victim from predator in text chats, Null, pp. 235-241, (2007); RahmanMiah M.W., Yearwood J., Kulkarni S., Detection of child exploiting chats from a mixed chat dataset as text classification task, Proceedings of the Australian Language Technology Association Workshop, pp. 157-165, (2011); Villatoro-Tello E., Juarez-Gonzalez A., Escalante H.J., Montes Y., Gomez M., Pineda L.V., A two-step approach for effective detection of misbehaving users in chats, CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), (2012); Wolak J., Finkelhor D., Mitchell K.J., Ybarra M.L., Online™ predators™ and their victims: Myths, realities, and implications for prevention and treatment, American Psychologist, 63, 2, (2008)","","Guezouli L.; Cruz H.T.; Hidoussi F.; Boubiche D.E.; Bounceur A.","Association for Computing Machinery","","International Conference on Internet of Things and Cloud Computing, ICC 2016","22 March 2016 through 23 March 2016","Cambridge","121387","","978-145034063-2","","","English","ACM Int.

Researchers have identified some important stages in this pattern. The psychological stages broadly include befriending, information exchange, grooming, and approach. Similarities among the posts of a chat play an important role in differentiating as well as in identifying these stages. In this article a novel similarity measure is constructed which gives high Inter-post-similarity among the chat-posts within a particular behavioral stage and low inter-post-similarity across different behavioral stages. A psychological stage corpus-based dictionary is constructed from mining the terms associated with each stage. The dictionary works as a background knowledge-base to support the similarity measure. To find the inter-post similarity a modified sentence similarity measure is used. The proposed measure gives improved recognition of inter-stage and intra-stage similarity among the chat posts compared with other types of similarity measures. The pairwise inter-post similarity is used for clustering chat-posts into the psychological stages. Results of experiments demonstrate that the new clustering method gives better results than some current clustering methods. © 2014 ASIS&T.","similarity; text mining; text processing","Cluster analysis; Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Text processing; Back-ground knowledge; Behavioral patterns; Clustering methods; Information exchanges; Sentence similarity; similarity; Similarity measure; Text mining; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Adams P.H., Martell C.H., Topic detection and extraction in chat, Proceedings of the Second IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, pp. 581-588, (2008); Armagh D.S., Battaglia N.L., Use of Computers in the Sexual Exploitation of Children, (2006); Bezdek J.C., Cluster validity with fuzzy sets, Journal of Cybernetics, 3, 3, pp. 58-72, (1974); Bezdek J.C., Mathematical models for systematics and taxonomy, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Numerical Taxonomy, pp. 143-166, (1975); Choo K.K.R., Online Child Grooming: A Literature Review on the Misuse of Social Networking Sites for Grooming Children for Sexual Offences, (2009); Ellis P.D., The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, (2010); Fellbaum C., Wordnet: An Electronic Lexical Database, (1998); Jiang J.J., Conrath D.W., Semantic similarity based on corpus statistics and lexical taxonomy, Proceedings of the International Conference on Research in Computational Linguistics, pp. 19-33, (1997); Krone T., Queensland Police Stings in Online Chat Rooms.

A number of studies have already addressed this issue, however, the data used in previous research did not properly represent the real chats found in multiplayer online games. To address this issue, we obtained real chat data from MovieStarPlanet, a massively multiplayer online game for children. The research described in this paper aimed to detect predatory behaviors in the chats using machine learning methods. In order to achieve a high accuracy on this task, extensive preprocessing was necessary. We describe three different strategies for data selection and preprocessing, and extensively compare the performance of different learning algorithms on the different data sets and features. © 2015 IEEE.","Chat; data mining; game data; natural language processing (NLP); preprocessing; sexual predator; text classification","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Chat; game data; NAtural language processing; preprocessing; sexual predator; Text classification; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Kontostathis A., Edwards L., Leatherman A., Text Mining and Cybercrime, pp. 149-164, (2010); Sonia L., Leslie H., Anke G., Kjartan O., Risks and Safety on the Internet: The Perspective of European Children: Full Findings and Policy Implications from the EU Kids Online Survey of 9-16 Year Olds and Their Parents in 25 Countries, (2011); Morris C., Identifying Online Sexual Predators by SVM Classification with Lexical and Behavioral Features, (2013); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proc. 3rd Workshop Comput.
