Objective: We conducted a feasibility study as an initial step toward formalizing the hybrid risk assessment model by identifying high-level digital forensic artifacts that have the potential to be valid and reliable indicators of risk, with a focus on CPORT Items 5, 6, and 7. Data: Law enforcement investigators from a High Tech Crime Unit (HTCU) randomly selected seven closed cases; selection criteria included: male offender over 18, mobile device, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) offense, and 2019–2023 index offense. Investigation details related to probable cause, final charges, conviction, and offender risk were not disclosed. Statistical information (f, %) for the following digital forensics artifacts was examined: 1) pornography collection (e.g., % of media, content type, gender ratio) and 2) evidence of networking/grooming and other problematic online activities (e.g., number of native messages vs. application messages; type of installed apps). Method: The analysis predicted whether the offender was a CSAM-only or dual offender and if our findings agreed with the level of risk for reoffending suggested by CPORT Items 5, 6, and 7. Results were shared with the HTCU and scored for accuracy. Results: The hybrid model was accurate in 6 of 7 cases. Conclusion: We conclude a hybrid model is feasible, and the findings illustrate the importance of analyzing app artifacts for context. Study limitations and future research recommendations are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Child sexual abuse materials; CPORT; Digital forensic artifacts; Dual offender; Non-contact offender; Offender risk","article; artifact; child sexual abuse; clinical article; crime; digital forensics; feasibility study; female; grooming; human; law enforcement; male; offender; patient selection; pornography; risk assessment","","","","","Lafayette Police Department; HTCU","We could not have conducted this research without the support of the Tippecanoe High Tech Crime Unit and Lafayette Police Department.

This book expands the lens of Cyberpsychology to consider how digital experiences play out across the various stages of people's lives. Most psychological research has focused on whether human-technology interactions are a 'good' or a 'bad' thing for humanity. This book offers a distinctive approach to the emergent area of Cyberpsychology, moving beyond these binary dilemmas and considering how popular technologies have come to frame human experience and relationships. In particular the authors explore the role of significant life stages in defining the evolving purpose of digital technologies. They discuss how people's symbiotic relationship with digital technologies has started to redefine our childhoods, how we experience ourselves, how we make friends, our experience of being alone, how we have sex and form romantic relationships, our capacity for being antisocial as well as the experience of growing older and dying.

Social engineering is one of them that addresses the multidisciplinary challenges of cyber security. Nowadays, the attacks associated with social engineering are diverse, including the so-called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These have been the subject of numerous investigations; however, cybernetic attacks of similar nature as grooming have been excluded from these studies. In the last decade, various efforts have been made to understand the structure and approach of grooming from the field of computer science with the use of computational learning algorithms. Nevertheless, these studies are not aligned with information security. In this work, the study of grooming is formalized as a social engineering attack, contrasting its stages or phases with life cycles associated with APTs. To achieve this goal, we use a database of real cyber-pedophile chats; this information was refined and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to determine the stages of the attack. Once the number of stages was determined, we proceed to give them a linguistic context, and with the use of machine learning, a linear model was trained to obtain 97.6% of training accuracy. With these results, it was determined that the study of grooming could support research associated with social engineering and contribute to new fields of information security. © 2013 IEEE.","APT; Cyber-pedophile; grooming; pattern behavior; pedophile; social engineering","Life cycle; Linguistics; Machine learning; Security of data; Statistics; Cyber-pedophile; grooming; pattern behavior; pedophile; Social engineering; Learning algorithms","","","","","Ecuadorian Corporation for the Development of Research; AcademyHealth, (GT-Cybersecurity)","This work was supported by the Ecuadorian Corporation for the Development of Research and the Academy (RED CEDIA) in the development of this study, within the Project under Grant GT-Cybersecurity.","Penna L., Clark A., Mohay G., Challenges of automating the detection of paedophile activity on the Internet, Proc. 1st Int.

Evidently, current research is primarily focused on its technological development. However, involving adolescents' voices regarding the desirability of this monitoring is important; particularly because automatic monitoring might invade adolescents' privacy and freedom, and consequently evoke reactance. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N = 66) between 12 and 18 years old. The goal was to obtain insights into adolescents' opinions on desirability and priorities for automatically detecting harmful content on SNSs. Opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of freedom. Most adolescents in this study are in favour of automatic monitoring for situations they perceive as uncontrollable or that they cannot solve themselves. Clear priorities for detection must be set in order to ensure the privacy and autonomy of adolescents. Moreover, monitoring actions aiming at the prevention of harm are required. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescents; Automatic monitoring; Online protection; Qualitative research; Social networking sites","","","","","","Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology; Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie, IWT, (120007)","This work was supported by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) under Grant 120007 .

Although cybergrooming has been recognized as a cybercrime, there is a lack of programs to protect youth from cybergrooming. We present a generative chatbot framework, SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate fluent authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot. Furthermore, we propose deep-reinforcement-learning-based dialogue generation with a stage-related reward to lead the conversation to the expected stage. We also minimize potential ethical issues introduced by the perverted languages when deploying the chatbots for cybersecurity education programs. We evaluated the conversations of SERI with open-source referenced, unreferenced metrics and human evaluation. We developed SERI as a platform for deploying perpetrator chatbot to interact with youth users to observe their responses and collect reactions when they are asked for private or sensitive information by the perpetrator. © 2023 IEEE.","chatbots; Cybergrooming; deep reinforcement learning; natural language processing","Cybersecurity; Deep learning; E-learning; Natural language processing systems; Chatbots; Cyber-crimes; Cybergrooming; Deep reinforcement learning; Dialogue generations; Educational program; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Guo Z., Cho J.-H., Chen I.-R., Sengupta S., Hong M., Mitra T., Online social deception and its countermeasures: A survey, Ieee Access, 9, pp. 1770-1806, (2021); Fauzi M.A., Bours P., Ensemble method for sexual predators identification in online chats, 2020 8th International Workshop on Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), pp. 1-6, (2020); Guo Z., Wang P., Cho J.-H., Huang L., Text miningbased social-psychological vulnerability analysis of potential victims to cybergrooming: Insights and lessons learned, Www '23 Companion, pp. 1381-1388, (2023); Choo K.R., Online Child Grooming: A Literature Review on the Misuse of Social Networking Sites for Grooming Children for Sexual Offences, 103, (2009); Lateef F., Simulation-based learning: Just like the real thing, Journal of Emergencies, Trauma and Shock, 3, 4, (2010); Winters G., Jeglic E., Stages of sexual grooming: Recognizing potentially predatory behaviors of child molesters, Deviant Behavior, pp. 1-10, (2016); Zambrano P., Torres J., Tello-Oquendo L., Jacome R., Benalcazar M.E., Andrade R., Fuertes W., Technical mapping of the grooming anatomy using machine learning paradigms: An information security approach, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 142129-142146, (2019); Laorden C., Galan-Garcia P., Santos I., Sanz B., Hidalgo J.M., Bringas P.G., Negobot: A conversational agent based on game theory for the detection of paedophile behaviour, International Joint Conference CISIS'12-ICEUTE 12-SOCO 12 Special Sessions, pp. 261-270, (2013); Wolf T., Sanh V., Chaumond J., Delangue C., TransferTransfo: A transfer learning approach for neural network based conversational agents, CoRR, (2019); Roy N., Pineau J., Thrun S., Spoken dialogue management using probabilistic reasoning, Proceedings of the 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 93-100, (2000); Lan R., Wang J., Huang W., Deng Z., Sun X., Chen Z., Luo X., Chinese emotional dialogue response generation via reinforcement learning, Acm Transactions on Internet Technology, 21, 4, pp. 1-17, (2021); Lai H., Toral A., Nissim M., Thank You BART!

Extremists' use of social media over the past decade or so has raised increasing concern among governments and media corporations alike. In Digital Grooming Nuria Lorenzo-Dus analyzes manipulation practices in digital spaces that are situated at, or beyond, the boundaries of law. Lorenzo-Dus identifies and examines in detail the online discourse of adults luring children for sexual abuse and exploitation (digital sexual grooming); extreme ideology groups aligning others to their views (digital ideological grooming); and drug dealers soliciting business in crypto markets (digital commercial grooming). With sophisticated style and stance analyses of large and varied datasets, the book reveals that digital sexual, ideological, and commercial grooming practices have much in common. Three stances—expertise, openness, and avidity—scaffold this manipulative work, which constructs groomers and their targets as sharing a homogenous identity. By shedding new light on grooming practices, this book provides a key resource for discourse analysis, forensic linguistics, communication, and media studies, as well as for practitioners aiming to counter online grooming through policy changes, detection software, and prevention-focused training to promote digital civility and safety. © Oxford University Press 2023.

Researchers have identified some important stages in this pattern. The psychological stages broadly include befriending, information exchange, grooming, and approach. Similarities among the posts of a chat play an important role in differentiating as well as in identifying these stages. In this article a novel similarity measure is constructed which gives high Inter-post-similarity among the chat-posts within a particular behavioral stage and low inter-post-similarity across different behavioral stages. A psychological stage corpus-based dictionary is constructed from mining the terms associated with each stage. The dictionary works as a background knowledge-base to support the similarity measure. To find the inter-post similarity a modified sentence similarity measure is used. The proposed measure gives improved recognition of inter-stage and intra-stage similarity among the chat posts compared with other types of similarity measures. The pairwise inter-post similarity is used for clustering chat-posts into the psychological stages.

This increase in popularity has also heightened safety concerns, as virtual sexual assault against children and the youth is on the rise. The issue of sexual abuse in the metaverse is becoming increasingly controversial due to the gaps in the current regulatory framework that result from the uncertain consequences of such virtual crimes. Drawing on an online survey of female users of Zepeto (n = 343), a metaverse social network platform where users interact with others while creating personalized avatars and virtual spaces, this study aims to explore how female users interpret the risk of sexual harassment in Zepeto, examining the triggers of emotional distress and behavioral change that result from such risk assessments by users. It investigates how these interpretations and responses vary depending on their sense of presence and engagement in the virtual environment and identification with their avatars and how all these processes differ between adolescent and adult female users. Overall, this study provides insights into the complex dynamics of virtual victimization. The findings could inform the development of regulatory frameworks that protect users from virtual sexual assault and create a safer environment for all users, especially the youngest generations.

Cyberpredators commit their crimes by employing the Internet and online services-social network platforms, online groups and organizations, smart phone apps, bulletin board systems, online forums, websites, internet relay chat channels-to locate and harm victims of all ages through attacking, exploiting, humiliating, bullying, harassing, threatening, defrauding, and extorting. Cyberpredators and Their Prey describes non-sexual and sexual interpersonal crimes-online romance scam, swatting, trolling, stalking, bullying, harassment, minor sexting, sexual trafficking, child sexual abuse material, sextortion, and image-based sexual abuse offenses. Each chapter contains: crime definition and relevant issues; typical cyberpredator, motives, and methods; typical victims and behaviors that make them targets; current criminal laws for prosecuting cybercrimes and assessment of their applicability and effectiveness as deterrents; the crime’s impact on individual victims and society in general; and cybersecurity prevention and intervention strategies. Also covered are the unique challenges that the regulation, investigation, and prosecution of these cybercrimes pose to criminal justice and private security agents worldwide; the need for society to hold companies operating online responsible for their role in cybercrime; and how aspects of the online environment (i.e., anonymity, toxic disinhibition, de-individuation, inculpability) contribute to harmful and abusive interpersonal interaction, particularly when enacted by perpetrators as part of a group attack. Key features: • Portrays material through multidisciplinary lens of psychology, criminal justice, law, and security • Provides consistent, practical information about online criminals and victims • Compares online to offline versions of the same crime • Discusses adequacy of current laws for prosecuting cybercriminals • Considers elements of the online environment that foster criminal activity • Describes social engineering techniques • Considers the role of intimate partner violence in cybercrimes • Reviews 21st century skills needed to educate and protect potential targets Cyberpredators and Their Prey will prove essential reading to those who are studying to become, or are currently, security professionals; law enforcement personnel and investigators; intelligence agents; private investigators; lawyers; compliance officers; social service workers; and other professionals who deal with interpersonal cybercrime through the lens of social science. © 2023 Lauren R.

It describes the CSAM ecosystem, focusing on the ways in which it is produced, distributed and consumed and explores different interventions that can be used to tackle each issue. Eliminating Online Child Sexual Abuse Material provides a methodical approach to unpacking and understanding this growing problem, identifies approaches that have been shown to work and offers alternatives that might be tried. This analysis is set within a crime science context that draws on rational choice, routine activities, situation crime prevention and environmental criminology to better understand the nature of the problem and the potential ways in which it may be solved. This book is intended for policymakers and practitioners working in child protection, online harms and related areas and for students studying sexual violence or internet-related crime. The book will also be of interest to crime scientists as it provides another example of how the approach can be used to understand and reduce crime. © 2023 Rick Brown.

We all either enjoy it, struggle with it, or may have been victims of it. Sexuality is not just about sex, but about human sexual function, the physiology of sex, the hormones involved and how they affect us, and the cultural norms related to it. Sexual function and dysfunction are closely tied to one’s self-esteem, self-respect, and to relationships with intimate partners. Human Sexuality: Function, Dysfunction, Paraphilias, and Relationships, explores the interplay of intimacy and sexuality; how it can enhance relationships, and how it can negatively affect them, or be affected by them. When individuals or partners encounter sexual problems or dysfunctions it can have a long-lasting affect both biologically and psychologically. Dr. Rokach explores the causes and the reasons that these dysfunctions are maintained, and successful treatment methods. Chapters on sexual offenses and paraphilias and what treatment options are available to sexual offenders are also included. This book is the first book to place sexuality where it belongs, within the context of relationships demonstrating how sexuality relates to intimacy by both enhancing and negatively affecting it. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The usefulness of these systems depend on the quality of data that can be used for training. Data in the domain are scarce, sensitive, and emotionally taxing for annotators. NLP researchers approximate victimization conversations using transcripts from internet stings performed by either vigilantes or LEOs, with an implicit assumption that vigilante or LEO conversations represent the victimization process. Psychology research, however, states that underage victim chats differ from internet stings in goal and modus operandi. We present a methodology and observations from annotating a corpus of victim, vigilante, and LEO conversations with convicted predators with the goal of comparing these chats. The corpus is annotated for stages and tactics of the victimization process described within psychology research. As predicted by psychological research, we found significant differences in the three classes of chats that are usually not taken into account in chat classification. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Law enforcement officers; Modus operandi; Psychological research; Quality of data; Victimisation; Crime","","","","","","","Aitken Susan, Gaskell Danielle, Hodkinson Alan, Online sexual grooming: exploratory comparison of themes arising from male offenders' communications with male victims compared to female victims, Deviant Behavior, 39, 9, pp. 1170-1190, (2018); Albahar Marwan, Almalki Jameel, Deep-fakes: Threats and countermeasures systematic review, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 97, 22, pp. 3242-3250, (2019); Bada Michael, Eckert Miriam, Evans Donald, Garcia Kristin, Shipley Krista, Sitnikov Dmitry, Baumgartner William A., Bretonnel Cohen K., Verspoor Karin, Blake Judith A., Et al., Concept annotation in the craft corpus, BMC Bioinformatics, 13, 1, (2012); Barber Connie, Bettez Silvia, Deconstructing the online grooming of youth: Toward improved information systems for detection of online sexual predators, (2014); Bayerl Petra S, Lungen Harald, Gut Ulrike, Paul Karsten I, Methodology for reliable schema development and evaluation of manual annotations, Proceedings of the Workshop on Knowledge Markup and Semantic Annotation at the Second International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2003), (2003); Bayerl Petra Saskia, Paul Karsten Ingmar, What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations? a meta-analytic investigation, Computational Linguistics, 37, 4, pp. 699-725, (2011); Beauregard Eric, Leclerc Benoit, Lussier Patrick, Decision making in the crime commission process: Comparing rapists, child molesters, and victim-crossover sex offenders, Criminal Justice and Behavior, 39, 10, pp. 1275-1295, (2012); Bergen Emilia, Antfolk Jan, Jern Patrick, Alanko Katarina, Santtila Pekka, Adults' sexual interest in children and adolescents online: A quasi-experimental study, International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 7, 2, (2013); Black Pamela J, Wollis Melissa, Woodworth Michael, Hancock Jeffrey T, A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child abuse & neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Bogdanova Dasha, Rosso Paolo, Solorio Thamar, On the impact of sentiment and emotion based features in detecting online sexual predators, Proceedings of the 3rd workshop in computational approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis, pp. 110-118, (2012); Bowen Glenn A, Naturalistic inquiry and the saturation concept: a research note, Qualitative research, 8, 1, pp. 137-152, (2008); Briggs Peter, Simon Walter T, Simonsen Stacy, An exploratory study of internet-initiated sexual offenses and the chat room sex offender: Has the internet enabled a new typology of sex offender?, Sexual Abuse, 23, 1, pp. 72-91, (2011); Cano Amparo Elizabeth, Fernandez Miriam, Alani Harith, Detecting child grooming behaviour patterns on social media, International conference on social informatics, pp. 412-427, (2014); Chiang Emily, Grant Tim, Deceptive identity performance: offender moves and multiple identities in online child abuse conversations, Applied Linguistics, 40, 4, pp. 675-698, (2019); Colton Matthew, Roberts Susan, Van-stone Maurice, Sexual abuse by men who work with children, Journal of child sexual abuse, 19, 3, pp. 345-364, (2010); DeHart Dana, Dwyer Gregg, Seto Michael C, Moran Robert, Letourneau Elizabeth, Schwarz-Watts Donna, Internet sexual solicitation of children: a proposed typology of offenders based on their chats, e-mails, and social network posts, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 23, 1, pp. 77-89, (2017); Diaz Maria, Panangadan Anand, Natural language-based integration of online review datasets for identification of sex trafficking businesses, 2020 IEEE 21st International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI), pp. 259-264, (2020); Ebrahimi Mohammadreza, Suen Ching Y, Ormandjieva Olga, Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); van Gijn-Grosvenor Evianne L., Lamb Michael E., Behavioural differences between online sexual groomers approaching boys and girls, Journal of Child Sexual Abuse, 25, 5, pp. 577-596, (2016); Gillespie Alisdair A, Child protection on the internet-challenges for criminal law, Child & Fam.

While strides have been made regarding the computational facets of algorithms for “real-time” risk detection, such research has not yet evaluated these advancements through a human-centered lens. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 53 peer-reviewed articles on real-time risk detection on social media. Real-time detection was mainly operationalized as “early” detection after-the-fact based on pre-defined chunks of data and evaluated based on standard performance metrics, such as timeliness. We identified several human-centered opportunities for advancing current algorithms, such as integrating human insight in feature selection, algorithms' improvement considering human behavior, and utilizing human evaluations. This work serves as a critical call-to-action for the HCI and ML communities to work together to protect social media users before, during, and after exposure to risks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)","Human-Centered Machine Learning; Literature Review; Online Risk; Real-Time Risk Detection; Social Media","Behavioral research; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Human-centered machine learning; Literature reviews; Machine-learning; Online risk; Real- time; Real-time risk detection; Research agenda; Risk detections; Social media; Social media platforms; E-learning","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (-2329976, -2333207, -1942610); National Science Foundation, NSF; William T.

A sexual predator is defined as a person who tries to obtain sexual favors in a predatory manner, usually with underage people. The proposed approach uses several text categorization methods and empirical behavioral features developed especially for the task at hand. After investigating various approaches for solving the sexual predator identification problem, we have found that a two-stage classifier achieves the best results. In the first stage, we employ a Support Vector Machine classifier to distinguish conversations having suspicious content from safe online discussions. This is useful as most chat conversations in real life do not contain a sexual predator, therefore it can be viewed as a filtering phase that enables the actual detection of predators to be done only for suspicious chats that contain a sexual predator with a very high degree. In the second stage, we detect which of the users in a suspicious discussion is an actual predator using a Random Forest classifier. The system was tested on the corpus provided by the PAN 2012 workshop organizers and the results are encouraging because, as far as we know, our solution outperforms all previous approaches developed for solving this task. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","","Decision trees;

Due to increased caseloads, machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) researchers are developing triage tools to help law enforcement officers (LEOs) identify potential enticement conversations. However, the datasets most readily available consist of Internet sting data where an officer or vigilante, known as a decoy, imitates a minor while talking to a potential solicitor. Psychology researchers note motivations of decoys and LEOs differ from those of at-risk minors and thus the conversations are likely incongruent. Previous research in the area is limited. Existing studies either do not include all three dataset types (victim, decoy, and LEOs) or examine usage of grooming stages and grooming strategies by each group, but not how these constructs intermingle. We extend the literature by examining the usage and sequencing of grooming stages in a chat, and the use of grooming strategies in grooming stages for all three groups. We find the greatest differences in the flow of grooming conversations with decoys, victims, and LEOs exist within the risk assessment, meeting, and sexual stages. Implications for LEOs, ML and NLP researchers are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Child sexual abuse; Computer-assisted crime; Online grooming","Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems;

Assistance in prioritizing cases of sexual exploitation of potentially risky conversations is crucial. While attempts to automatically triage conversations for the risk of sexual exploitation of minors have been attempted in the past, most computational models use features which are not representative of the grooming process that is used by investigators. Accurately annotating an offender corpus for use with machine learning algorithms is difficult because the stages of the grooming process feed into one another and are non-linear. In this paper we propose a method for labeling risk, tied to stages and themes of the grooming process, using fuzzy sets. We develop a neural network model that uses these fuzzy membership functions of each line in a chat as input and predict the risk of interaction. © 2019 IEEE.","","Fuzzy neural networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Membership functions; Computational model; Fuzzy membership function; Neural network model; Non linear; Risk perception","","","","","Purdue Research Foundation","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was partially supported by Purdue Research Foundation.","Online Enticement of Children: An In-Depth Analysis of CyberTipLine Reports, (2017); Whittle H.C., Hamilton-Giachritsis C., Beech A.R., Victimsfffdfffdfffd voices: The impact of online grooming and sexual abuse, Universal Journal of Psychology, 1, 2, pp. 59-71, (2013); Chiu M.M., Seigfried-Spellar K.C., Ringenberg T.R., Exploring detection of contact vs. fantasy online sexual offenders in chats with minors: Statistical discourse analysis of self-disclosure and emotion words, Child Abuse & Neglect, 81, pp. 128-138, (2018); Connell R.O., A Typology of Child Cybersexploitation and Online Grooming Practices, (2003); Olson L.N., Daggs J.L., Ellevold B.L., Rogers T., Entrapping the innocent: Toward a theory of child sexual predators' luring communication, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 231-251, (2007); Black P.J., Wollis M., Woodworth M., Hancock J.T., A linguistic analysis of grooming strategies of online child sex offenders: Implications for our understanding of predatory sexual behavior in an increasingly computer-mediated world, Child Abuse & Neglect, 44, pp. 140-149, (2015); Babchishin K.M., Hanson R.K., VanZuylen H., Online child pornography offenders are different: A meta-analysis of the characteristics of online and offline sex offenders against children, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44, 1, pp. 45-66, (2015); Parapar J., Losada D.E., Barreiro A., A learning-based approach for the identification of sexual predators in chat logs, CLEF, 1178, (2012); Ebrahimi M., Suen C.Y., Ormandjieva O., Detecting predatory conversations in social media by deep convolutional neural networks, Digital Investigation, 18, pp. 33-49, (2016); Barber C., Bettez S., Deconstructing the Online Grooming of Youth: Toward Improved Information Systems for Detection of Online Sexual Predators, (2014); Bogdanova D., Rosso P., Solorio T., Exploring highlevel features for detecting cyberpedophilia, Computer Speech & Language, 28, 1, pp. 108-120, (2014); Bayerl P.S., Paul K.I., What determines inter-coder agreement in manual annotations.

Chinese text analysis requires not only statistics but also semantic comprehension analysis. Different text types need other language style feature modeling to obtain good recognition results. In this study, we use the deep learning method to construct an automatic text feature extraction model and classify it with the author as a classification label. This study presents a literature author recognition model based on deep learning, which is mainly divided into three phases: text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Each part consists of several small modules or steps. First, we input the corpus to Word2Vec to generate the new word vector. Then, the improved text feature extractor based on CNN and Attention extracts the text features and uses them as the input of the CNN convolution layer. After convolution, the text is combined with bits to get Window Feature Sequence. It is the text feature vector. Next, based on LSTM and Softmax classification output, Window Feature Sequence is used as the input of LSTM to obtain two one-dimensional vectors spliced by concatenate layer. Finally, the result is classified through the fully connected layer, Batch Normalization layer, and Softmax. The performance of the proposed model in recognizing authors of Chinese literature was evaluated using two datasets. In the research process, the data we collected included works of different forms, such as prose and fiction. The research results show that the proposed model can effectively identify author identity. The classification accuracy of our proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of the benchmark model. © 2024 The Author","Attentional mechanisms; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Long-and short-term memory network (LSTM); Text analysis","","","","","","TF-IDF","Zhao Y. et al. used 365 function words as text features to identify the authors of Associated Press (AP) Newswire articles in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) corpus of AP. The experiment proved that function words play a good role in describing the authors of articles and are an important text feature [14]. Yu B. explored the role of function words in the corpus of Chinese literary works of nine authors in three periods and three styles, and tested the effect of 35 Chinese function words as stylistic features through three sets of Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering experiments, and came to the following conclusions: Chinese function words can be used as stylistic features for genre identification and author identification, but they have no significant time sensitivity and are basically independent of time period [15]. Ma Jianbin et al. used lexical Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and structural features as stylistic feature sets, and used support vector machine algorithm to conduct experiments on the corpus of blogs, BBS and E-mail, and concluded that: A higher accuracy can be obtained by combining linguistic features and structural features, but the effect of the two features is not obvious when used alone. Single-layer feature extraction cannot meet the needs of accuracy of author identification, and only multi-layer feature extraction can better obtain text features [16]. Hassan F H. et al. tested the N-grams of the first character, middle character and end character of text words, and the experiment proved that only the first character bi-gram and tri-gram could effectively identify the author [17]. Goebel R. used DepWords coding instead of syntactic dependency to identify authors of detective novels, and the experiment achieved a high accuracy [18].YÜLÜCE and DALKILIÇ conducted an experiment for identification of authors in Turkish language texts using machine learning techniques. They have used TF-IDF features for extracting the features of each document. Then, several classifiers such as: Ensemble learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) were examined for author identification. Their results, showed the superiority of SGD over other classifiers [24].","Yale G.U., On sentence length as a statistical characteristic of style in prose with application to two cases of disputed authorship [J], Biometrika, 30, pp. 363-390, (1938); Gani J., Literature and atatisticsfM]//Kotz SJonhnson N L.Encyclo— Pedia of Statistics, pp. 90-95, (1985); Valenza R.J., Are the Thisted-Efron authorship tests valid?, JJCom- puter and the Humanities, 25, pp. 27-46, (1991); Khmelev D., Tweedy F.J., Using Markov chains for identification of writers[J], Lit.

Many early research works have applied the footprints left by online predators to investigate online grooming. While digital forensics tools provide security to online users, it also encounters some critical challenges, such as privacy issues and the lack of data for research in this field. Our literature review investigates all research papers on grooming detection in online conversations by looking at the psychological definitions and aspects of grooming. We study the psychological theories behind the grooming characteristics used by machine learning models that have led to predatory stage detection. Our survey broadly considers the authorship profiling research works used for grooming detection in online conversations, along with predatory conversation detection and predatory identification approaches. Various approaches for online grooming detection have been evaluated based on the metrics used in the grooming detection problem. We have also categorized the available datasets and used feature vectors to give readers a deep knowledge of the problem considering their constraints and open research gaps. Finally, this survey details the constraints that challenge grooming detection, unaddressed problems, and possible future solutions to improve the state-of-the-art and make the algorithms more reliable. © 2022 The Author(s)","Chat analysis;

This paper reviews the existing BEA approaches and process models and concludes the lack of standardisation in the BEA process. The research comprehends that existing BEA methodologies are restricted to specific characteristics of the forensic domain in question. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a standardised approach detailing the step-by-step implementation of BEA in the DF process. The proposed model presents a homogenous technique that can be practically applied to real-life cases. This standard BEA framework classifies digital evidence into categories to decipher associated offender characteristics. Unlike existing models, this new approach collects evidence from diverse sources and leaves no aspect unattended while probing criminal behavioural cues, thus facilitating its applicability across varied forensic domains. © 2021 IGI Global.

It provides an authoritative synthesis of the disparate literature on the various types of cybercrime, the global investigation and detection of cybercrime and the role of digital information, and the wider role of technology as a facilitator for social relationships between deviants and criminals. It includes coverage of: Key theoretical and methodological perspectives; computer hacking and malicious software; digital piracy and intellectual theft; economic crime and online fraud; pornography and online sex crime; cyber-bullying and cyber-stalking; cyber-terrorism and extremism; digital forensic investigation and its legal context around the world; the law enforcement response to cybercrime transnationally; cybercrime policy and legislation across the globe. The new edition features two new chapters, the first looking at the law enforcement response to cybercrime and the second offering an extended discussion of online child pornography and sexual exploitation. This book includes lively and engaging features, such as discussion questions, boxed examples of unique events and key figures in offending, quotes from interviews with active offenders, and a full glossary of terms. This new edition includes QR codes throughout to connect directly with relevant websites. It is supplemented by a companion website that includes further exercises for students and instructor resources. This text is essential reading for courses on cybercrime, cyber-deviancy, digital forensics, cybercrime investigation, and the sociology of technology. © 2018 Thomas J. Holt, Adam M.

The authors have drawn on their extensive experience in training undercover officers to develop innovative methods in identifying the creation and performance of online personas, crucial in detecting identity disguise online. This groundbreaking book demonstrates these methods through case studies, whilst also exploring the link between language and identity. By bringing together previously opposed positions in forensic authorship analysis, the book develops a novel theory of linguistic identity, which will resonate not just in forensic authorship research but in sociolinguistics more widely. This unique forensic linguistic project has real-life impact in assisting the police in their investigation of online abusers, and has impact for students and researchers of linguistics, through its contribution to the research of linguistic identities. © Tim Grant and Nicci MacLeod 2020.

From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.  © 2021 ACM.","artificial intelligence; human-centered machine learning; literature review; online risks; sexual risk detection; social media","Computational methods; Crime; E-learning; Machine learning; Computational approach; Computational risks; Human-centered machine learning; Literature reviews; Online risk; Risk detections; Sexual risk detection; Social media; Systematic literature review; Victimisation; Social networking (online)","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (-1827700, -1844881); William T.

All of the reports strongly suggested that it becomes very urgent to tackle the online child grooming problem in order to protect children from sexual exploitation. Automatic sexual predator identification can be a promising solution to this issue since the number of online conversations is too large to be monitored manually. In this work, a two-stage is proposed with a combination of several features. The first stage is for detecting the predatory conversations while the second step aims to distinguish the predator from the victim in the predatory conversations. The features ensemble used will be combining lexical and behavioral features. The lexical features used include BoW, POS-based, topical, and emotion-based. Meanwhile, the behavioral features used for this work include the number of messages, the average number of words, the number of exclamation marks, the number of questions, sentence complexity and readability, and the number of intentions. SVM was used as a classifier due to its good ability for many text classification tasks. The experiment result shows that BoW with tf - idf term weighting provided the best performance for both PCI and VPD tasks. BoW with tf- idf term weighting obtained an F0.5 score of 0.9893 on PCI and 0.9798 on VPD. The features ensemble can exceed most of the individual features that form it but still cannot beat BoW. © 2023 IEEE.","Bag of Words; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Sexual Predator; SVM","Classification (of information); Text processing; Average numbers; Bag of words; Behavioral features; Chat; Conversation; Ensemble; Lexical features; Sexual predator; SVM; Term weighting; Support vector machines","","","","","","","Wachs S., Wolf K.D., Pan C.-C., Cybergrooming: Risk factors, coping strategies and associations with cyberbullying, Psicothema, 24, 4, pp. 628-633, (2012); Choo K.-K.R., Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences, 103, (2009); Kierkegaard S., Cybering, online grooming and ageplay, Computer Law & Security Review, 24, 1, pp. 41-55, (2008); Clement J., Internet usage of teenagers in the united states - statistics facts, (2019); Britain G., Children and parents: Media use and attitudes report, (2013); Madigan S., Villani V., Azzopardi C., Laut D., Smith T., Temple J.R., Browne D., Dimitropoulos G., The prevalence of unwanted online sexual exposure and solicitation among youth: A meta-analysis, Journal of Adolescent Health, 63, 2, pp. 133-141, (2018); Vilarino D., Castillo E., Pinto D., Olmos I., Leon S., Information retrieval and classification based approaches for the sexual predator identification; Borj P.R., Bours P., Predatory conversation detection, 2019 International Conference on Cyber Security for Emerging Technologies (CSET).
