"3 Automatic Identification of Cyber Predators Using Text Analytics and Machine Learning","",,Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in Digital Forensics,"","2022","","","41","54","Digital forensics is the science of detecting evidence from digital media like a computer, smart phone, server, or network. It provides the forensic team with the most beneficial methods to solve confused digital-related cases. AI and blockchain can be applied to solve online predatory chat cases and photo forensics cases, provide network service evidence, custody of digital files in forensic medicine, and identify roots of data scavenging. The increased use of PCs and extensive use of internet access, has meant easy availability of hacking tools. Over the past two decades, improvements in the information technology landscape have made the collection, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence extremely important. The traditional tools for solving cybercrimes and preparing court cases are making investigations difficult. We can use AI and blockchain design frameworks to make the digital forensic process efficient and straightforward. AI features help determine the contents of a picture, detect spam email messages and recognize swatches of hard drives that could contain suspicious files. Blockchain-based lawful evidence management schemes can supervise the entire evidence flow of all of the court data. This book can provide a wide-ranging overview of how AI and blockchain can be used to solve problems in digital forensics using advanced tools and applications available on the market.","","9788770226875","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9933574.pdf&bkn=9933495&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","31 Oct 2022","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Because the pervasiveness of the problem scale, it may only be tamed effectively and efficiently by using an automatic grooming conversation detection system. Previously, Pranoto, Gunawan, and Soewito [1] had developed a logistic model for the purpose and the model was able to achieve 95% detection accuracy. The current study intends to address the issue by using Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors classifiers. In addition, the study also proposes a low-computational cost classification method on the basis of the number of the existing grooming conversation characteristics. All proposed methods are evaluated using 150 conversation texts of which 105 texts are grooming and 45 texts are non-grooming. We identify that grooming conversations possess 17 features of grooming characteristics. The results suggest that the SVM and k-NN are able to identify grooming conversations at 98.6% and 97.8% of the level of accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed simple method has 96.8% accuracy. The empirical study also suggests that two among the seventeen characteristics are insignificant for the classification.","","978-1-5090-5130-4","10.1109/KICSS.2016.7951413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7951413","Online Child Grooming;Support Vector Machine;k-nearest Neighbors;Grooming Classifier","Support vector machines;Training;Feature extraction;Creativity;Social network services;Testing;Electronic mail","","9","","20","IEEE","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the last few years, the rate of online grooming has seen a massive increase along with an increase in the number of teenage users. The proposed system, Prevention of Emotional Entrapment of Children (PEEC), consists of an age detection module using Deep Neural Network (DNN) as well as a grooming detection module using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to monitor the conversations of only those users who come under the category of minor (below 18). The resultant system gave an accuracy of 84% for age detection and 91% for grooming detection.","","978-1-6654-1559-0","10.1109/ICETCI51973.2021.9574068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9574068","Online grooming;paedophilia;child harassment;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)","Support vector machines;Social networking (online);Sociology;Pressing;Propulsion;Real-time systems;Optical character recognition software","","","","24","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the worst forms of cyber-security issues is child grooming, where sexual predators seek contact with minors to abuse them. Various types of organizations such as chat providers and law enforcement are inclined to find online predatory conversations in order to protect the children. This paper proposes a study on predatory conversation detection using Natural Language Processing. We analyzed the different types of features of online grooming data considering various characteristics of online conversation, such as psycho-linguistic patterns. Our experiments with online communication showed an accuracy of 0.98 in automatically classifying the conversations into predatory conversations and non-predatory conversations. Best results are obtained by using linear SVM on 1-gram features when removing stop words as well as by using multinomial Naïve Bayes on 1-gram features when not removing stop words.","","978-1-7281-4538-9","10.1109/CSET.2019.8904885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8904885","","","","12","","17","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, adults and minors are able to exchange sexually explicit messages and media via a variety of online platforms that are widely available, which leads to an increasing concern of child grooming. Traditionally, the identification of child grooming relies on the analysis and localisation of conversation texts, but this is usually time-consuming and associated with other implications such as psychological pressure on the investigators. Therefore, automatic methods to detect grooming conversations have attracted the attention of many researchers. This paper proposes such a system to identify child grooming in online chat conversations, where the training data of the system were harvested from publicly available information. The data processing is based on a group of AI technologies, including fuzzy-rough feature selection and fuzzy twin support vector machine. Evaluation shows the promise of the proposed approach in identifying online grooming conversations to be implemented in the future after further development to support real-world cases.","1558-4739","978-1-5386-1728-1","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858973","","Feature extraction;XML;Support vector machines;Training data;Digital forensics;Keyword search;Tools","","8","","26","IEEE","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All of the reports strongly suggested that it becomes very urgent to tackle the online child grooming problem in order to protect children from sexual exploitation. Automatic sexual predator identification can be a promising solution to this issue since the number of online conversations is too large to be monitored manually. In this work, a two-stage is proposed with a combination of several features. The first stage is for detecting the predatory conversations while the second step aims to distinguish the predator from the victim in the predatory conversations. The features ensemble used will be combining lexical and behavioral features. The lexical features used include BoW, POS-based, topical, and emotion-based. Meanwhile, the behavioral features used for this work include the number of messages, the average number of words, the number of exclamation marks, the number of questions, sentence complexity and readability, and the number of intentions. SVM was used as a classifier due to its good ability for many text classification tasks. The experiment result shows that BoW with tf - idf term weighting provided the best performance for both PCI and VPD tasks. BoW with tf- idf term weighting obtained an F0.5 score of 0.9893 on PCI and 0.9798 on VPD. The features ensemble can exceed most of the individual features that form it but still cannot beat BoW.","","979-8-3503-1487-8","10.1109/ETNCC59188.2023.10284950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284950","Chat;Sexual Predator;SVM;Bag of Words;Ensemble;Conversation","Support vector machines;Text categorization;Oral communication;Market research;Feature extraction;Behavioral sciences;Complexity theory","","","","33","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing data-driven approaches usually face the challenges of lack of training data and the uncertainty of classes in terms of the classification or decision boundary. This paper proposes a grooming detection approach in an effort to address such uncertainty based on a data set derived from a publicly available profiling data set. In particular, the approach firstly applies the conventional text feature extraction approach in identifying the most significant words in the data set. This is followed by the application of a fuzzy-rough feature selection approach in reducing the high dimensions of the selected words for fast processing, which at the same time addressing the uncertainty of class boundaries. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting child grooming.","","978-1-5090-6020-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491591","","Feature extraction;Uncertainty;Data mining;Digital forensics;Dictionaries;XML;Electronic mail","","24","","25","IEEE","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several existing approaches analyze a limited amount of information stemming from the interactions of the child with the corresponding online party. Some restrict access to websites based on a blacklist of known forbidden URLs, others attempt to parse and analyze the exchanged multimedia content between the two parties. However, new URLs can be used to circumvent a blacklist, and images, video, and text can individually appear to be safe, but need to be judged jointly. We propose a highly modular framework of analyzing content in its final form at the user interface, or Human Computer Interaction (HCI) layer, as it appears before the child: on the screen and through the speakers. Our approach is to produce Children’s Agents for Secure and Privacy Enhanced Reaction (CASPER), which analyzes screen captures and audio signals in real time in order to make a decision based on all of the information at its disposal, with limited hardware capabilities. We employ a collection of deep learning techniques for image, audio and text processing in order to categorize visual content as pornographic or neutral, and textual content as cyberbullying or neutral. We additionally contribute a custom dataset that offers a wide spectrum of objectionable content for evaluation and training purposes. CASPER demonstrates an average accuracy of 88% and an F1 score of 0.85 when classifying text, and an accuracy of 95% when classifying pornography.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114389","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through Next Generation Internet (NGI) Trust(grant numbers:825618); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9541357","Cyber-bullying;cyber-grooming;online safety;pornography filter;real time agent","Feature extraction;Streaming media;Visualization;Training;Skin;Real-time systems;Hardware","","9","","43","CCBY","20 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
