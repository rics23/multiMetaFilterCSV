We compare four regionalization approaches in terms of their fitness for analysis and display: max-p-regions, regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning (REDCAP), and self-organizing map (SOM) variants of each. Each method is used to create a configuration of regions that aligns with census boundaries, optimizes intraunit homogeneity, and maximizes the number of spatial units while meeting the minimum population threshold required for sharing PHI under HIPAA guidelines. The relative utility of each configuration was assessed with measures of model fit, compactness, homogeneity, and resolution. Adding the SOM procedure to max-p-regions resulted in statistically significant improvements for nearly all assessment measures, whereas the addition of SOM to REDCAP primarily degraded these measures. These differences can be attributed to the different impacts of SOM on top-down and bottom-up regionalization procedures. Overall, we recommend REDCAP, which outperformed on most measures. The SOM variant of max-p-regions (MSOM) could also be recommended, because it provided the highest resolution while maintaining suitable performance on all other measures. © 2022 The Author(s).

A total of 221 disadvantaged and seventy-four non-disadvantaged women aged 18-35 years were recruited. Diet was assessed using a diet history protocol. Of the total population, 153 disadvantaged and sixty-three non-disadvantaged women were classified as plausible dietary reporters. Food group intakes, nutrient intakes and dietary vitamin and mineral concentrations per MJ of energy consumed were compared between the disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged populations, as was compliance with dietary fibre, macronutrient and micronutrient intake guidelines. The disadvantaged women had lower intakes than the non-disadvantaged women of fruit, vegetables, fish, breakfast cereals, low-fat milk and wholemeal bread (all P< 0·001), yogurt (P= 0·001), low-fat spread (P= 0·002) and fresh meat (P= 0·003). They also had higher intakes of butter, processed red meats, white bread, sugar-sweetened beverages, fried potatoes and potato-based snacks (all P< 0·001) and full-fat milk (P= 0·014). Nutritionally, the disadvantaged women had higher fat, saturated fat and refined sugar intakes; lower dietary fibre, vitamin and mineral intakes; and lower dietary vitamin and mineral densities per MJ than their more advantaged peers. Non-achievement of carbohydrate (P= 0·017), fat (P< 0·001), saturated fat (P< 0·001), refined sugar (P< 0·001), folate (P= 0·050), vitamin C (P< 0·001), vitamin D (P= 0·047) and Ca (P= 0·019) recommendations was more prevalent among the disadvantaged women. Both groups showed poor compliance with Fe and Na guidelines. We conclude that the nutritional deficits present among these socially disadvantaged women are significant, but may be potentially ameliorated by targeted food-based interventions. © The Authors 2013.",Dietary intakes; Irish women; Low socio-economic status; Nutrients,Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Deficiency Diseases; Diet; Female; Food Habits; Health Promotion; Humans; Ireland; Nutrition Policy; Nutritive Value; Patient Compliance; Risk; Socioeconomic Factors; Trace Elements; Urban Health; Vitamins; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult; ascorbic acid; calcium; carbohydrate; folic acid; iron; saturated fatty acid; sodium; trace element; vitamin D; adult; article; body weight; bread; butter; calcium intake; carbohydrate intake; cereal; comparative study; diet supplementation; dietary compliance; dietary fiber; dietary intake; fat intake; female; fish; food intake; fruit; human; Ireland; iron intake; macronutrient; milk; mineral intake; nutritional deficiency; physical activity; potato; red meat; sedentary lifestyle; social class; sodium intake; vegetable; vitamin intake; waist circumference,,"ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; calcium, 14092-94-5, 7440-70-2; folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; sodium, 7440-23-5; Trace Elements, ; Vitamins, ",,,,,"Barrington R., Poverty is Bad for your Health, Dublin:Combat Poverty Agency, (2004); Barry J., Sinclair H., Kelly A., Et al., Inequalities in Health in Ireland - Hard Facts, Dublin: Department of Community Health, (2001); Balanda K., Wilde J., Inequalities in Mortality: A Report on All-Ireland Mortality Data 1989-1998, (2001); James W.P., Nelson M., Ralph A., Et al., Socioeconomic determinants of health.
