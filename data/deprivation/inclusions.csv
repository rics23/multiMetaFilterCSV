This paper identifies the effect and mechanisms of digital economy on “Common Prosperity” from the perspective of income inequality by using the data of China household finance survey (CHFS). The empirical results show: 1) Digital economy can significantly reduce income inequality, which is still valid after we consider the endogeneity and perform corresponding robustness test. 2) The mechanism analysis shows that digital economy can effectively reduce household income inequality by mitigating the liquidity constraints, enhancing entrepreneurial activity and expanding household social network. 3) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the alleviating effect of digital economy on income inequality is more significant in the central and western provinces, rural areas and regions with lower level of digital economy, particularly for household with lower education, lower financial literacy, and larger digital divide, which signifies the inclusiveness of digital economy. Further discussion shows that all sub-indexes of digital economy can significantly narrow the household income gap, among which the digital dividend formed by digital efficiency improvement index has a greater gain effect on it. Hence, this paper provides theoretical support and empirical evidence for promoting the development of China’s digital economy and “Common Prosperity”. © 2024 Chinese Chemical Society.
