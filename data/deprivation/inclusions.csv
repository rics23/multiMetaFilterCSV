Correlation analysis was conducted and mixed-effects negative binomial (MENB) models were developed to assess CaBi ridership by the type of CaBi user, as the available bike-sharing trip data followed a time-series cross-section panel data structure and the variables (season, stay-at-home order and lift, and weekday) have time-specific effects. The correlation coefficients between CaBi variables, COVID-19 variables, and characteristics of D.C.’s population profile and their statistical significance are sensitive to the year (2019 or 2020), the season of the year (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall), and the type of CaBi user (member or casual user). The number of stations between pickups and drop-offs, and the dummy variables representing the before and after stay-at-home order and lift were found significant in the MENB models. There was no significant difference in travel time of CaBi casual users and members during the outbreak. Riding for leisure or commuting has been potentially limited with the stay-at-home order. The findings have practical implications and help bike-sharing operators to increase their resilience during unexpected situations such as the pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study tries to evaluate, through a multidisciplinary approach, the relationship between urban structure, isolation and distribution of social determinants of health, in the so-called ""formerly-Bastogi, a compound, with more than 1,500 inhabitants, located in north-western Rome, Italy. Methods. The architectural-urban analysis, conducted through site visits and evaluations of urban situation, showed how strongly the compound is isolated from the neighbourhoods, and structurally degraded. The socio-demographic analysis, based on the National Census data, showed significant differences in the distribution of the social determinants of health between ""formerly-Bastogi"" and the surrounding areas. Results. The area under study appears to be isolated from the surrounding urban space, both because of social and architectural factors. This situation could have some association with inhabitants' health. Conclusions. If our preliminary investigation was useful for a diagnosis of the situation, a more complete - qualitative and quantitative - investigation of the context will be needed to plan appropriate multidisciplinary health-promoting interventions. © 2019 Societa Editrice Universo.",Rome suburb; Social determinants; Spatial segregation; Urban divide; Urban inequalities,Age Distribution; Built Environment; City Planning; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Interdisciplinary Research; Residence Characteristics; Rome; Sex Distribution; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; article; demography; human; Italy; neighborhood; social determinants of health; age distribution; city planning; epidemiology; health disparity; interdisciplinary research; questionnaire; sex ratio; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; urban population,,,,,,,"Marmot M., Social determinants of health inequalities, Lancet, 365, pp. 1099-1104, (2005); Deverteuil G., Social Science & Medicine Conceptualizing violence for health and medical geography, Soc Sci Med, 133, pp. 216-222, (2015); Hosseinpoor A.R., Bergen N., Mendis S., Harper S., Verdes E., Kunst A., Socioeconomic inequality in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in low-and middle-income countries: Results from the World Health Survey, BMC Public Health, 12, (2015); Mackenbach J.P., Kulhanova I., Artnik B., Et al., Changes in mortality inequalities over two decades: register based study of European countries, BMJ Open, 353, (2016); Stringhini S., Rousson V., Viswanathan B., Gedeon J., Paccaud F., Bovet P., Association of Socioeconomic Status with Overall and Cause Specific Mortality in the Republic of Seychelles: Results from a Cohort Study in the African Region, PLoS One, 9, pp. 1-8, (2014); Muennig P., Fiscella K., Tancredi D., Franks P., The Relative Health Burden of Selected Social and Behavioral Risk Factors in the United States: Implications for Policy, Res Pract, 100, pp. 1758-1764, (2010); Mackenbach J.P., Stirbu I., Roskam A.J.R., Et al., Socioeconomic Inequalities in Health in 22 European Countries, N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 2468-2481, (2008); Corburn J., Cohen A.K., Why We Need Urban Health Equity Indicators: Integrating Science, Policy, and Community, PLOS Med, 9, pp. 1-6, (2012); Hayward E., Ibe C., Young J.H., Et al., Linking social and built environmental factors to the health of public housing residents: a focus group study, BMC Public Health, pp. 1-8, (2015); Snyder V.N.S., De Friel S., Fotso J.C., Et al., Social Conditions and Urban Health Inequities: Realities, Challenges and Opportunities to Transform the Urban Landscape through Research and Action, J Urban Heal Bull New York Acad Med, 88, pp. 1183-1193, (2011); D'Alessandro D., Apolloni L., Capasso L., Public health and urban planning: a powerful alliance to be enhanced in Italy, Ann Ig, 29, 5, pp. 453-463, (2017); State of the World's Cities 2010/11.
