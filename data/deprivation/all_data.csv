Method We carried out a systematic literature review. We consulted four electronic databases and Google Scholar, for studies published between 2010 and 2018. Results We analyzed 126 articles. In 62.7%, territory was studied as the axis of inequa-lity, followed by socioeconomic determinants (27.8%). Neonatal, infant and under-five mortality was analyzed as an output in health in 19.0%, 49.2% and 32.3%, respectively. It predominated ecological (62.7%) and longitudinal (50.0%) studies. Significant reduc-tions in mortality rates were found, however, the decline was not homogeneous among subpopulations. Conclusions The literature reports a marked decrease in under-five mortality; howe-ver, the gaps between different axes of inequality continue and in some cases they have increased. Gaps varied according to time, place, axis of inequality and type of mortality analyzed. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

However, measuring SES in ways usable for healthcare research is a challenge. We present the HOUSES index, an extensively validated way of measuring SES for healthcare applications, and show its use in detecting and measuring performance disparities in AI models. Going beyond measurement and theorizing about causal mechanisms, we take an understanding of AI as a form of causality-agnostic statistical modeling that automatically finds optimal correlations. With this, we present a hypothesis and supporting evidence that a lack of healthcare access among those of lower SES propagates through to these patients having lower-quality healthcare data, which leaves less of a valid signal for AI models to pick up, ultimately resulting in lower performance for those of lower SES. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: All LCS low-dose CT appointments scheduled at an urban, tertiary care academic medical center in the New England region between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, were included. Demographics, insurance type, information on social determinants of health, and appointment status were obtained from the electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the associations between the appointment status and the explanatory variables. Results: During the study period, 2,797 patients had 4,747 scheduled LCS appointments. Forty-one percent of patients had at least one missed appointment, and 32.7% of all scheduled appointments were missed. The retention rate of patients after the baseline examination was approximately 50%. Self-reported Black race was independently associated with 1.5 times the odds of missing appointments compared with White race (P = .012). Patients with Medicaid had 6.1 times the odds of missing appointments compared with patients with private insurance and 4.6 times the odds of missing appointments compared with patients with Medicare (P < .0001). Housing insecurity was a risk factor for failing to follow up after the baseline examination, with an odds ratio of 5.3 (P = .0013). Conclusions: The high rate of missed LCS appointments underscores the need to improve screening compliance. The identification of specific social determinants of health that contribute to disparities in access to LCS could empower policymakers, hospital systems, and providers to use targeted interventions to promote more equitable access. © 2021 American College of Radiology",Lung cancer screening; missed imaging opportunities; racial disparities; screening adherence; social determinants of health,Aged; Appointments and Schedules; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Medicare; Social Determinants of Health; United States; adult; Article; Black person; cancer screening; Caucasian; controlled study; electronic medical record; female; follow up; hospital planning; housing; human; low-dose computed tomography; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medicaid; medicare; middle aged; risk factor; social determinants of health; tertiary health care; United States; university hospital; aged; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; hospital management; lung tumor; social determinants of health,,,,,"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (U54TR001012)",,"Siegel R.L., Miller K.D., Jemal A., Cancer statistics 2020, CA Cancer J Clin, 70, pp. 7-30, (2020); Aberle D.R., Adams A.M., Et al., Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening, N Engl J Med, 365, pp. 395-409, (2011); Krist A.H., Davidson K.W., Et al., Screening for lung cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement, JAMA, 325, pp. 962-970, (2021); Jemal A., Fedewa S.A., Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography in the United States—2010 to 2015, JAMA Oncol, 3, pp. 1278-1281, (2017); Steiling K., Loui T., Asokan S., Et al., Age, race, and income are associated with lower screening rates at a safety net hospital, Ann Thorac Surg, 109, pp. 1544-1550, (2020); Rivera M.P., Katki H.A., Tanner N.T., Et al., Addressing disparities in lung cancer screening eligibility and healthcare access.

Tools to evaluate the built envirAims onment using machine vision and informatic approaches have been limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between machine vision–based built environment and prevalence of cardiometabolic disease in US cities. Methods This cross-sectional study used features extracted from Google Street View (GSV) images to measure the built environment and link them with prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Convolutional neural networks, linear mixed-effects models, and activation maps were utilized to predict health outcomes and identify feature associations with CHD at the census tract level. The study obtained 0.53 million GSV images covering 789 census tracts in seven US cities (Cleveland, OH; Fremont, CA; Kansas City, MO; Detroit, MI; Bellevue, WA; Brownsville, TX; and Denver, CO). Results Built environment features extracted from GSV using deep learning predicted 63% of the census tract variation in CHD prevalence. The addition of GSV features improved a model that only included census tract-level age, sex, race, income, and education or composite indices of social determinant of health. Activation maps from the features revealed a set of neighbourhood features represented by buildings and roads associated with CHD prevalence. Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, the prevalence of CHD was associated with built environment factors derived from GSV through deep learning analysis, independent of census tract demographics. Machine vision–enabled assessment of the built environment could potentially offer a more precise approach to identify at-risk neighbourhoods, thereby providing an efficient avenue to address and reduce cardiovascular health disparities in urban environments. Structured Graphical Abstract Key Question Is a deep learning-based assessment of the built environment from street view images associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence at the census tract level in the United States? Key Finding Google Street View (GSV) images of seven US cities were associated with 63% of the variance in prevalence of CHD. Compared with a model including age, sex, race, income, education, and composite indices for social determinants of health, addition of GSV features enhanced the association with CHD. Take Home Message Neighborhood characteristics derived from street view imagery are significantly associated with more than 60% of the regional variability in cardiovascular disease. This suggests that further exploring GSV-based cardiometabolic risk estimation is warranted.

Addressing SDOH is crucial for promoting health equity and reducing health outcome disparities. For conditions such as stroke and cancer screening where imaging is central to diagnosis and management, access to high-quality medical imaging is necessary. This article applies a previously described structural framework characterizing the impact of SDOH on patients who require imaging for their clinical indications. SDOH factors can be broadly categorized into five sectors: economic stability, education access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health care access and quality. As patients navigate the health care system, they experience barriers at each step, which are significantly influenced by SDOH factors. Marginalized communities are prone to disparities due to the inability to complete the required diagnostic or screening imaging work-up. This article highlights SDOH that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, using stroke and cancer as examples of disease processes where imaging is needed for care. Potential strategies to mitigate these disparities include dedicating resources for clinical care coordinators, transportation, language assistance, and financial hardship subsidies. Last, various national and international health initiatives are tackling SDOH and fostering health equity.  © RSNA, 2024.",,Aging; Diagnostic Imaging; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Social Determinants of Health; Stroke; age; air quality; atherosclerosis; breast cancer; cancer screening; cerebrovascular accident; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; economic instability; economic stability; ethnicity; female; financial stress; food insecurity; health care system; health equity; human; imaging; ischemic stroke; magnetic resonance angiography; mammography; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quality of life; race; Review; sex; social determinants of health; social isolation; socioeconomics; thorax radiography; traffic and transport; aging; diagnostic imaging; health care access,,,,,"Katz Academy of Translational Research; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, NPC","Disclosures of conflicts of interest: M.M.E.

Participants IN-LiMeS is a multicentre and multipurpose pool of metropolitan population cohorts enrolled in nine Italian cities: Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Florence, Leghorn, Prato and Rome. Data come from record linkage of municipal population registries, the 2001 population census, mortality registers and hospital discharge archives. Depending on the source of enrolment, cohorts can be closed or open. The census-based closed cohort design includes subjects resident in any of the nine cities at the 2001 census day; 4 466 655 individuals were enrolled in 2001 in the nine closed cohorts. The open cohort design includes subjects resident in 2001 or subsequently registered by birth or immigration until the latest available follow-up (currently 31 December 2013). The open cohort design is available for Turin, Venice, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Prato and Rome. Detailed socioeconomic data are available for subjects enrolled in the census-based cohorts; information on demographic characteristics, education and citizenship is available from population registries. Findings to date The first IN-LiMeS application was the study of differentials in mortality between immigrants and Italians. Either using a closed cohort design (nine cities) or an open one (Turin and Reggio Emilia), individuals from high migration pressure countries generally showed a lower mortality risk. However, a certain heterogeneity between the nine cities was noted, especially among men, and an excess mortality risk was reported for some macroareas of origin and specific causes of death. Future plans We are currently working on the linkage of the 2011 population census data, the expansion of geographical coverage and the implementation of the open design in all the participating cohorts. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

However, such an approach is uncommon. In this study, we identified neighbourhoods with elevated prevalence of childhood obesity ('hotspots') in the Porto Metropolitan Area and investigated to what extent the socio-economic and built environment characteristics of the neighbourhoods explained such hotspots. Methods: We used data on 5203 7-year-old children from a population-based birth cohort, Generation XXI. To identify hotspots, we estimated local obesity odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using generalized additive models with a nonparametric smooth for location. Measures of the socio-economic and built environment were determined using a Geographic Information System. Associations between obesity and neighbourhood characteristics were expressed as OR and 95%CI after accounting for individual-level variables. Results: At 7 years of age, 803 (15.4%) children were obese. The prevalence of obesity varied across neighbourhoods and two hotspots were identified, partially explained by individual-level variables. Adjustment for neighbourhood characteristics attenuated the ORs and further explained the geographic variation. This model revealed an association between neighbourhood socio-economic deprivation score and obesity (OR=1.014, 95%CI 1.004-1.025), as well as with the presence of fast-food restaurants at a walkable distance from the residence (OR=1.37, 1.06-1.77). Conclusions: In our geographic area it was possible to identify neighbourhoods with elevated prevalence of childhood obesity and to suggest that targeting such high-priority neighbourhoods and their environmental characteristics may help reduce childhood obesity. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Residing in disadvantaged communities may also confer the risk of neurodegenerative brain changes via cardiometabolic pathways. This study tested whether features of communities - apart from conventional socioeconomic characteristics - relate not only to cardiometabolic risk but also to relative tissue reductions in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Methods Participants were 699 adults aged 30 to 54 years (340 women; 22.5% non-White) whose addresses were geocoded to compute community indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, as well as air and toxic chemical pollutant exposures, homicide rates, concentration of employment opportunities, land use (green space), and availability of supermarkets and local resources. Participants also underwent assessments of cortical and hippocampal volumes and cardiometabolic risk factors (adiposity, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipids). Results Multilevel structural equation modeling demonstrated that cardiometabolic risk was associated with community disadvantage (β = 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01 to 0.18), as well as chemical pollution (β = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.19), homicide rates (β = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.18), employment opportunities (β = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.27 to -0.04), and green space (β = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.20 to -0.04). Moreover, cardiometabolic risk indirectly mediated the associations of several of these community features and brain tissue volumes. Some associations were nonlinear, and none were explained by participants' individual-level socioeconomic characteristics. Conclusions Features of communities other than conventional indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage may represent nonredundant correlates of cardiometabolic risk and brain tissue morphology in midlife.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",AHAB-2 = Adult Health and Behavior Phase 2; BMI = body mass index; BP = blood pressure; cerebral cortex; COI = Child Opportunity Index; EPA = Environmental Protection Agency; health inequalities; hippocampus; ICV = intracranial volume; Key words/Abbreviations; MPRAGE = magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; MSEM = multilevel structural equation model; neighborhood disadvantage; PIP = Pittsburgh Imaging Project; PM = particulate matter; RSEI = Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators; socioeconomic position; SPM = statistical parametric mapping; UCR = Uniform Crime Reporting; ZBP = ZIP Codes Business Patterns; ZIP = Zone Improvement Plan,"Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Crime; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Neighborhood Characteristics; Parks, Recreational; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; adult; air pollution; Article; brain; brain tissue volume; cardiometabolic risk; cardiometabolic risk factor; cardiovascular risk; community resource; cortical volume; crime; cross-sectional study; educational status; employment; female; food availability; hippocampal volume; homicide; human; income; land use; male; neighborhood; obesity; particulate matter exposure; sociodemographics; socioeconomics; structural equation modeling; volume; cardiovascular disease; crime; heart disease risk factor; neighborhood characteristic; recreational park; residence characteristics; risk factor",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P01 HL040962, R01 HL1089850); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (R01 DK 110041); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK","Source of Funding and Conflicts of Interest: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers P01 HL040962 and R01 HL1089850, as well as by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases under Award number R01 DK 110041.

Several studies reported the clinical findings of the characteristics of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. There have been issues with genetic, biochemical, or pathophysiological problems. Some studies have been conducted on non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and social factors, for instance, racial disparities in peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) or the social setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, there have been insufficient materials to consider the relationship between social factors and clinical course in non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. There were various methodologies in therapeutic interventions, such as pharmacological, surgical, or rehabilitational, and educational issues. However, interventions that could be closely associated with social inequality have not been sufficiently elucidated. We will summarize the effects of social equality, which could have a large impact on the development and progression of HF in non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.

These indicators were flattened by the Local Empirical Bayesian Model and Global and Local Moran statistics were applied. The indepen-dent variables were selected from the IBGE-2010 Census. Multivariate regressions were employed, followed by spatial regression. Leprosy exhibited a heterogeneous distribution in the state, with con-centration in the north-west axis and the south region. For the general detection coefficient, five variables composed the final model: demogra-phic density, urban population proportion, per capita income, proportion of extremely poor and households with over three people per dormitory. The illiteracy proportion made up the final model for the grade II rate of physical disability. No determinants of the occurrence of the disease were identified in children under 15. The modeling used contributed to demonstrate the spatial heterogeneity and social determinants of the disease in Bahia, revealing the complexity of the problem. © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

This study aimed to evaluate the individual and joint associations of depression and sleep duration with CMDs and mortality. Methods: A total of 261,297 participants who were free of CMD at baseline were included. Sleep duration was divided into three groups (short: <7 h/day, referent: ages 39–64 years: 7–9 h/day; ages 65+ years: 7–8 h/day, and long: ages 39–64 years: >9 h/day; ages 65+ years: >8 h/day). The main outcomes were hypertension, stroke, CHD, DM, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Results: Among the 261,297 participants, depression and short or long sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of CMDs and mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10–1.38) when they were mutually adjusted, except for the association between short sleep duration and stroke (HR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97–1.10). We documented significant additive interactions between depression and short sleep duration in relation to all-cause mortality (relative excess risk due to interaction [RERI], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.02–0.37) and CHD (RERI, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–0.48). Conclusions: In this study, depression and short or long sleep duration were independently associated with an increased risk of CMDs and mortality. We also observed significant additive interactions between depression and short sleep duration in relation to all-cause mortality and CHD. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiometabolic diseases; Depression; Joint association; Mortality; Sleep duration,Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Depression; Humans; Hypertension; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Stroke; adult; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drinking behavior; female; follow up; human; hypertension; ICD-10; ICD-9; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mortality; prospective study; sex difference; sleep time; Townsend deprivation index; aged; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; depression; hypertension; middle aged; risk factor; sleep; sleep disorder,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81822004); Central South University, CSU, (2020CX017); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFC2008002); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2020RC4006, 2021RC2014)","This study was funded by the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province (No. 2021RC2014 and No. 2020RC4006 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81822004 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFC2008002 ), and the Project of Innovation-driven Plan in Central South University (No. 2020CX017) .

Retrospective cohort data came from Korea National Health Insurance Service claims data for 43,251 participants, who were aged 15–79 years, lived in the same districts of Seoul and had no history of antidepressant medication during 2002–2012. The dependent variable was antidepressant-free months during 2013–2015 and the 30 independent variables for 2012 were included (demographic/socioeconomic information, health information, district-level information including PM2.5). Random forest variable importance, the contribution of a variable for the performance of the model, was used for identifying major predictors of antidepressant-free months. Based on random forest variable importance, the top 15 determinants of antidepressant medication during 2013–2015 included cardiovascular disease (0.0054), age (0.0047), household income (0.0037), gender (0.0027), the district-level proportion of recipients of national basic living security program benefits (0.0019), district-level social satisfaction (0.0013), diabetes mellitus (0.0012), January 2012 PM.2.5 (0.0011), district-level street ratio (0.0010), drinker (0.0009), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.0008), district-level economic satisfaction (0.0006), exercise (0.0005), March 2012 PM.2.5 (0.0005) and November 2012 PM2.5 (0.0004). Besides these predictors, smoker and district-level deprivation index are found to be influential most widely, given that they ranked within the top 10 most often in sub-group analysis. In conclusion, antidepressant medication has strong associations with neighborhood conditions including socioeconomic satisfaction and the seasonality of particulate matter. Strong interventions for these factors are really needed for the effective management of major depressive disorder. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Antidepressant; Neighborhood condition; Particulate matter; Socioeconomic satisfaction,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Antidepressive Agents; Depressive Disorder, Major; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Machine Learning; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; Particulate Matter; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; amfebutamone; antidepressant agent; mirtazapine; monoamine oxidase inhibitor; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; trazodone; antidepressant agent; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; dependent variable; female; household income; human; independent variable; machine learning; major clinical study; major depression; male; medical information; middle aged; national health insurance; neighborhood; particulate matter; patient satisfaction; random forest; retrospective study; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; machine learning; major depression; particulate matter; public health; young adult",,"amfebutamone, 31677-93-7, 34911-55-2; mirtazapine, 61337-67-5; trazodone, 19794-93-5, 25332-39-2; Air Pollutants, ; Antidepressive Agents, ; Particulate Matter, ",,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST, (NRF-2020M3E5D9080792)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology ( NRF-2020M3E5D9080792 ).

This social epigenomics study included long-term childhood cancer survivors enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. DNA methylation (DNAm) data were generated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip, and three social determinants of health (SDOH) factors were assessed: self-reported educational attainment, personal income, and an area deprivation index based on census track data. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed to evaluate the relation between DNAm at each 5’-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3’ (CpG) site and each SDOH factor based on multivariable linear regression models stratified by ancestry (European ancestry, n = 1,618; African ancestry, n = 258). EWAS among survivors of European ancestry identified 130 epigenome-wide significant SDOH–CpG associations (P < 9 × 10−8), 25 of which were validated in survivors of African ancestry (P < 0.05). Thirteen CpGs were associated with all three SDOH factors and resided at pleiotropic loci in cigarette smoking–related genes (e.g., CLDND1 and CPOX). After accounting for smoking and body mass index, these associations remained significant with attenuated effect sizes. Seven of 13 CpGs were associated with gene expression level based on 57 subsamples with blood RNA sequencing data available. In conclusion, DNAm signatures, many resembling the effect of tobacco use, were associated with SDOH factors among survivors of childhood cancer, thereby suggesting that biologically distal SDOH factors influence health behaviours or related factors, the epigenome, and subsequently survivors’ health. © 2022 The Author(s).

Study Design: Observational study. Methods: During influenza vaccination clinics in 2008, trained staff provided FITs to patients who were eligible for CRCS (FLU-FIT group) (FLU indicates influenza vaccine). Screening outcomes for this cohort of patients were compared with those of a similar group of influenza clinic attendees who were not exposed to the intervention (FLUonly group). Results: Among eligible participants in the FLUonly group (N = 4653), 13.7% completed FIT within 90 days of their influenza vaccine, and in the FLU-FIT group (N = 2812), 30.3% completed FIT (P <.0001). In the FLU-FIT group, 1447 (51.4%) were provided with a FIT kit, and 653 (45.1%) of these patients completed a FIT kit within 90 days. In multivariate analyses, FLU-FIT group participants were significantly more likely to complete FITs compared with FLU-only group participants (Odds Ratio = 2.76 [95% confidence interval, 2.45- 3.11]). Overall, the CRCS rate for the FLU-only group increased from 51.5% to 56.3% (increase of 4.8 percentage points), compared with an increase from 49.2% to 63.2% (increase of 14.0 percentage points) in the FLU-FIT group (P <.0001 for change difference). Conclusions: The FLU-FIT Program is feasible to implement in a high volume influenza vaccination clinic conducted in a managed care setting and increases colorectal cancer screening activity among eligible influenza vaccination recipients who are reached with the intervention.",,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Immunization Programs; Influenza Vaccines; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; United States; influenza vaccine; adult; aged; article; cancer screening; colorectal cancer; feasibility study; female; health care; health program; hospital; human; immunochemistry; influenza; major clinical study; male; priority journal; screening; staff; vaccination",,"Influenza Vaccines, ",,,,,"Jemal A., Siegel R., Xu J., Ward E., Cancer statistics, 2010, Ca Cancer J Clin, 60, pp. 277-300, (2010); Whitlock E.P., Lin J.S., Liles E., Beil T.L., Fu R., Screening for colorectal cancer: A targeted, updated systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Ann Intern Med, 149, pp. 638-658, (2008); Levin B., Lieberman D.A., McFarland B., Smith R.A., Brooks D., Andrews K.S., Dash C., Giardiello F.M., Glick S., Levin T.R., Pickhardt P., Rex D.K., Thorson A., Winawer S.J., Screening and surveillance for the early detection of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps, 2008: A joint guideline from the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology, CA Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 58, 3, pp. 130-160, (2008); Vital signs: Colorectal cancer screening among adults aged 50-75 years - United States, 2008, MMWR Morb Moral Wkly Rep, 59, pp. 808-812, (2010); 2009 Strategic Plan Progress Report; Holden D.J., Jonas D.E., Porterfield D.S., Reuland D., Harris R., Systematic review: Enhancing the use and quality of colorectal cancer screening, Ann Intern Med, 152, pp. 668-676, (2010); Potter M.B., Phengrasamy L., Hudes E.S., McPhee S.F., Walsh J.M., Offering annual fecal occult blood tests at annual flu shot clinics increases colorectal cancer screening rates, Ann Fam Med, 7, pp. 17-23, (2009); Potter M.B., Yu T.M., Gildengorin G., Et al., Adaptation of the FLU-FOBT Program for a primary care clinic serving a poor Chinese-American community: New evidence of effectiveness, J Health Care Poor Underserved; Differences among the Forcast, Flesch-Kincaid, and Flesch Reading Ease Formulas; Messer L.C., Laraia B.A., Kaufman J.S., Eyster J., Holzman C., Culhane J., Elo I., Burke J.G., O'Campo P., The development of a standardized neighborhood deprivation index, Journal of Urban Health, 83, 6, pp. 1041-1062, (2006); Church T.R., Yeazel M.W., Jones R.M., Kochevar L.K., Watt G.D., Mongin S.J., Cordes J.E., Engelhard D., A randomized trial of direct mailing of fecal occult blood tests to increase colorectal cancer screening, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 96, 10, pp. 770-780, (2004); Denberg T.D., Coombes J.M., Byers T.E., Marcus A.C., Feinberg L.E., Steiner J.F., Ahnen D.J., Effect of a mailed brochure on appointment-keeping for screening colonoscopy: A randomized trial, Annals of Internal Medicine, 145, 12, pp. 895-900, (2006); Myers R.E., Sifri R., Hyslop T., Rosenthal M., Vernon S.W., Cocroft J., Wolf T., Andrel J., Wender R., A randomized controlled trial of the impact of targeted and tailored interventions on colorectal cancer screening, Cancer, 110, 9, pp. 2083-2091, (2007); Sequist R., Zaslavsky A.M., Marshall R., Et al., Patient and physician reminders to promote colorectal cancer screening: A randomized controlled trial, Arch Intern Med, 169, pp. 364-371, (2009); Stokamer C.L., Tenner C.T., Chaduri J., Vazquez E., Bini E.J., Randomized controlled trial of the impact of intensive patient education on compliance with fecal occult blood testing, J Gen Intern Med, 142, pp. 86-94, (2005); Tu S.-P., Taylor V., Yasui Y., Chun A., Yip M.-P., Acorda E., Li L., Bastani R., Promoting culturally appropriate colorectal cancer screening through a health educator: A randomized controlled trial, Cancer, 107, 5, pp. 959-966, (2006)","M.B.

We explored its association with socioeconomic adversities and academic-behavior-health difficulties, which remain unaddressed. METHODS: This cross-sectional school-based-population study compared the above factors of middle-school adolescents with allergyuntreated and those with treated allergy (allergytreated) (mean age = 13.5 ± 1.2) from north-eastern France. Participants completed a questionnaire collecting socioeconomic adversities (nonintact family, low parents' education, insufficient family income, poor social support, suffered verbal/physical violence, and sexual abuse), low academic performance, excessive screen time, substance use, sleep difficulty, poor physical health, depressive symptoms, suicide attempt, poor quality of life, and allergytreated/allergyuntreated. RESULTS: Logistic regression models showed that allergyuntreated was associated with all the factors considered (sex-age-class-level-adjusted odds ratio (saclOR) reaching 3.94, p <.001) and the risk score (number of main criteria: suffered sexual abuse, excessive screen time, poor quality of life, cannabis use, low parents' education, and poor social support): saclOR 4.75, 9.23, 15.64, and 31.73 (p <.001) for risk scores 1, 2, 3, and ≥4, versus risk score = 0 (pseudo-R2 = 11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic adversities and academic-behavior-health difficulties may be used to detect adolescents with allergyuntreated for care. © 2024, American School Health Association.",family-academic-behavior-health difficulties;

Our goal is to investigate utilities of AI in poverty prediction via finding answers to the following research questions: (1) How many papers on utilities of AI in poverty prediction were published up until March, 2022? (2) Which approach to poverty was applied when AI was used for poverty prediction? (3) Which AI methods were applied for predicting poverty? (4) What data were used for poverty prediction via AI? (5) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the created AI models for poverty prediction? In order to answer these questions, we selected twenty-two papers using appropriate keywords and the exclusion criteria and analyzed their content. The selection process identified that, since 2016, publications on AI applications in poverty prediction began. Results of our research illustrate that, during this relatively short period, the application of AI in predicting poverty experienced a significant progress. Overall, fifty-seven AI methods were applied during the analyzed span, among which the most popular one was random forest. It was revealed that with the adoption of AI tools, the process of poverty prediction has become, from one side, quicker and more accurate and, from another side, more advanced due to the creation and possibility of using different datasets. The originality of this work is that this is the first sophisticated survey of AI applications in poverty prediction. © 2022 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; deep learning; machine learning; poverty; remote sensing; wealth,artificial intelligence; machine learning; poverty; prediction; remote sensing; research and development,,,,,,,"Stolbov M., Shchepeleva M., Modeling global real economic activity: Evidence from variable selection across quantiles, J.
